    passage: "Compact discs (CDs), which may be found in over 25 million American homes, not to mention backpacks and automobiles, first entered popular culture in the 1980s. But their history goes back to the 1960s, when an inventor named James Russell decided to create an alternative to his scratched and warped phonograph records—a system that could record, store, and replay music without ever wearing out.\n\nThe result was the compact disc (CD). Made from 1.2 mm of polycarbonate plastic, the disc is coated with a much thinner aluminum layer that is then protected with a film of lacquer. The lacquer layer can be printed with a label. CDs are typically 120 mm in diameter, and can store about 74 minutes of music. There are also discs that can store 80, 90, 99, and 100 minutes of music, but they are not as compatible with various stereos and computers as the 74–minute size.\n\nThe information on a standard CD is contained on the polycarbonate layer, as a single spiral track of pits, starting at the inside of the disk and circling its way to the outside. This information is read by shining light from a 780 nm wavelength semiconductor laser through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The light from the laser follows the spiral track of pits, and is then reflected off either the pit or the aluminum layer. Because the CD is read through the bottom of the disc, each pit looks like a bump to the laser.\n\nInformation is read as the laser moves over the bumps (where no light will be reflected) and the areas that have no bumps, also known as land (where the laser light will be reflected off the aluminum). The changes in reflectivity are interpreted by a part of the compact disc player known as the detector. It is the job of the detector to convert the information collected by the laser into the music that was originally recorded onto the disc. This invention brought 22 patents to James Russell, who today says he working on an even better system for recording and playing back music.",

    passage: "The beginning of the twenty-first century has been called the end of the supermodel era by fashion magazines, trend watchers, and news organizations around the world. The models are being replaced, so the theory goes, with actors. Check the covers of fashion magazines, and you will find that many on any given month feature an actor, rather than a model. But, as with most trends, this is nothing new.\n\nFrom its beginnings in the 1920s, the modeling industry has provided beautiful people to help sell everything from magazines to computers to vacation destinations. John Robert Powers, who opened the first modeling agency in 1923, was a former actor who hired his actor friends to model for magazine advertisements. Cary Grant, Lucille Ball, and Princess Grace of Monaco were clients. However, for many models simply being “great-looking” was where their resumés began and ended. The height of popularity for them was in the 1980s and 1990s, the era of the supermodel. A handful of “perfect” women commanded salaries of up to $25,000 a day to walk catwalks at fashion shows, appear in print ads, and pose their way through commercials. They were celebrities, treated with all of the lavish attention usually paid to heads of state or rock stars.\n\nBut that was in the supermodel heyday. As designers and magazine editors began to favor more exotic and more “real” looking models, the modeling handful grew into an army. The demand for the perfect looking select few dropped, and women who had quirky smiles, a few extra pounds, spiky hair, or were past their twenties, gained favor. This group was joined by those who achieved success in some other venue, such as music (think Renee Fleming raving about a watch), sports (Tiger Woods happily devouring his Wheaties®), and acting (Danny Glover waxing rhapsodic over MCI). Iconic fashion designer Calvin Klein summed it up: “I don’t think that people are that interested in models anymore. It’s not a great moment for the modeling industry. It says a lot about our society and I think it’s good.”",

    id: "passage-4-shopping-malls",
    passage: "Today’s shopping mall has as its antecedents historical marketplaces, such as Greek agoras, European piazzas, and Asian bazaars. The purpose of these sites, as with the shopping mall, is both economic and social. People go not only to buy and sell wares, but also to be seen, catch up on news, and be part of the human drama. Both the marketplace and its descendant the mall might also contain restaurants, banks, theaters, and professional offices.\n\nThe mall is also the product of the creation of suburbs. Although villages outside of cities have existed since antiquity, it was the technological and transportation advances of the 19th century that gave rise to a conscious exodus of the population away from crowded, industrialized cities toward quieter, more rural towns. Since the suburbs typically have no centralized marketplace, shopping centers or malls were designed to fill the needs of the changing community, providing retail stores and services to an increasing suburban population.\n\nThe shopping mall differs from its ancient counterparts in a number of important ways. While piazzas and bazaars were open-air venues, the modern mall is usually enclosed. Since the suburbs are spread out geographically, shoppers drive to the mall, which means that parking areas must be an integral part of a mall’s design. Ancient marketplaces were often set up in public spaces, but shopping malls are designed, built, and maintained by a separate management firm as a unit. The first shopping mall was built by J. C. Nichols in 1922 near Kansas City, Missouri. The Country Club Plaza was designed to be an automobile-centered plaza, as its patrons drove their own cars to it, rather than take mass transportation as was often the case for city shoppers. It was constructed according to a unified plan, rather than as a random group of stores. Nichols’ company owned and operated the mall, leasing space to a variety of tenants.\n\nThe first enclosed mall was the Galleria Vittoria Emanuele in Milan, Italy in 1865–77. Inspired by its design, Victor Gruen took the shopping and dining experience of the Galleria to a new level when he created the Southdale Center Mall in 1956. Located in a suburb of Minneapolis, it was intended to be a substitute for the traditional city center. The 95-acre, two-level structure had a constant climate-controlled temperature of 72 degrees, and included shops, restaurants, a school, a post office, and a skating rink. Works of art, decorative lighting, fountains, tropical plants, and flowers were placed throughout the mall. Southdale afforded people the opportunity to experience the pleasures of urban life while protected from the harsh Minnesota weather.\n\nIn the 1980s, giant megamalls were developed. While Canada has had the distinction of being home to the largest of the megamalls for over twenty years, that honor will soon go to Dubai, where the Mall of Arabia is being completed at a cost of over five billion U.S. dollars. The 5.3 million square foot West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, opened in 1981, with over 800 stores, 110 eating establishments, a hotel, an amusement park, a miniature-golf course, a church, a zoo, and a 438-foot-long lake. Often referred to as the “eighth wonder of the world,” the West Edmonton Mall is the number-one tourist attraction in the area, and will soon be expanded to include more retail space, including a facility for sports, trade shows, and conventions.\n\nThe largest enclosed megamall in the United States is Bloomington, Minneapolis’s Mall of America, which employs over 12,000 people. It has over five hundred retail stores, an amusement park which includes an indoor roller coaster, a walk-through aquarium, a college, and a wedding chapel. The mall contributes over one billion dollars each year to the economy of the state of Minnesota. Its owners have proposed numerous expansion projects, but have been hampered by safety concerns due to the mall’s proximity to an airport.",

    id: "passage-5-sushi",
    passage: "Burgers, fries, pizza, raw fish. Raw fish? Fast food in America is changing. Sushi, the thousand year old Japanese delicacy, was once thought of in this country as unpalatable and too exotic. But tastes have changed, for a number of reasons. Beginning in the 1970s, Americans became increasingly more aware of diet and health issues, and began rejecting their traditional red-meat diets in favor of healthier, lower fat choices such as fish, poultry, whole grains, rice, and vegetables. The way food was prepared began to change, too; rather than frying food, people started opting for broiled, steamed, and raw versions. Sushi, a combination of rice and fish, fit the bill. In addition, that same decade saw Japan become an important global economic force, and companies began flocking to the country to do business. All things Japanese, including décor, clothing, and cuisine, became popular.\n\nSushi started small in the United States, in a handful of restaurants in big cities. But it caught on. Today, sushi consumption in American restaurants is 40% greater than it was in the late 1990s, according to the National Restaurant Association. The concession stands at almost every major league stadium sell sushi, and many colleges and universities offer it in their dining halls. But we’re not just eating it out. The National Sushi Association reports that there are over 5,000 sushi bars in supermarkets, and that number is growing monthly. This incredible growth in availability and consumption points to the fact that Americans have decided that sushi isn’t just good for them, or just convenient, but that this once-scorned food is truly delicious.\n\nThe origins of this food trend may be found in Asia, where it was developed as a way of preserving fish. Fresh, cleaned fish was pressed between rice and salt and weighted with a heavy stone over a period of several months. During this time, the rice fermented, producing lactic acid that pickled and preserved the fish. For many years, the fish was eaten and the rice was discarded. But about 500 years ago, that changed, and hako-zushi (boxed sushi) was created. In this type of sushi, the rice and fish are pressed together in a box, and are consumed together.\n\nIn 1824, Yohei Hanaya of Edo (now called Tokyo) eliminated the fermentation process, and began serving fresh slices of seafood on bases of vinegared rice. The vinegar was probably used to mimic the taste of fermented sushi. In fact, the word sushi actually refers to any vinegared rice dish, and not to the fish, as many Americans believe (the fish is called sashimi). In Japanese, when sushi is combined with a modifier, it changes to the word zushi.\n\nChef Yohei’s invention, called nigiri zushi, is still served today. It now refers to a slice of fish (cooked or uncooked) that is pressed by hand onto a serving of rice. Popular choices include ama ebi (raw shrimp), shime saba (marinated mackerel), and maguro (tuna). In addition to the vinegar flavor in the rice, nigiri zushi typically contains a taste of horseradish (wasabi), and is served with soy sauce for dipping.\n\nMaki zushi contains strips of fish or vegetables rolled in rice and wrapped in thin sheets of nori, or dried seaweed. Popular ingredients include smoked salmon, fresh crab, shrimp, octopus, raw clams, and sea urchin. Americans have invented many of their own maki zushi combinations, including the California roll, which contains imitation crabmeat and avocado. They have also made innovations in the construction of maki zushi. Some American sushi bars switch the placement of nori and rice, while others don’t use nori, and instead roll the maki zushi in fish roe. These colorful, crunchy eggs add to the visual and taste appeal of the dish.",

    passage: "PASSAGE 1\n\nThere comes a time in every boy’s life when he becomes a man. On this fateful day, he will be swept up and put on an island to compete for one million dollars. Then, this man will realize that money can’t buy happiness. He will find his soul mate, as we all do, on national TV, picking a woman out of a line of twenty. By then it will be time for him to settle down, move to the suburbs, make friends with the neighbors, and then refurbish the neighbors’ house.\n\nWelcome to real life. That is, real life as the television networks see it.\n\nReality TV is flawed in many ways, but the most obvious is in its name. It purports to portray reality, but no “reality” show has succeeded in this endeavor. Instead, Reality TV is an extension of fiction, and there are no writers who need to be paid. Television executives love it because it is so much cheaper to produce than any other type of programming, and it’s popular. But the truth is that there is little or no reality in Reality TV.\n\nDo you sing in the shower while dreaming of getting your own record deal? There are a couple of shows made just for you. Audition, and make the cut, so some British guy who has never sung a note can rip you to pieces on live television. Or maybe you’re lonely and fiscally challenged, and dream of walking down the aisle with a millionaire? Real marriage doesn’t involve contestants who know each other for a couple of days. The people on these shows seem to be more interested in how they look on camera than in the character of the person they might spend the rest of their life with. Let’s hope that isn’t reality.\n\nThere are also about a dozen decorating shows. In one case, two couples trade rooms and redecorate for each other. The catch is, interior designers help them. This is where the problem starts. Would either couple hire someone who thinks it’s a great idea to swathe a room in hundreds of yards of muslin, or to adhere five thousand plastic flowers as a mural in a bathroom? The crimes committed against defenseless walls are outrageous. When you add the fact that the couples are in front of cameras as well as the designers, and thus unable to react honestly to what is going on, you get a new level of “unreality.”\n\nThen there is the show that made the genre mainstream—Survivor. The show that pits men and women from all walks of life against each other for a million dollar prize in the most successful of all the Reality TV programs. What are record numbers of viewers tuning in to see? People who haven’t showered or done their laundry in weeks are shown scavenging for food and competing in ridiculous physical challenges. Where’s the reality? From the looks of it, the contestants spend most of their time, when not on a Reality TV show, driving to the Burger Barn and getting exercise only when the remote goes missing.\n\nSo the television networks have used Reality TV to replace the dramas and comedies that once filled their schedules, earning millions in advertising revenue. The lack of creativity, of producing something worth watching, is appalling. We are served up hundreds of hours of Reality TV each week, so we can watch real people in very unreal situations, acting as little like themselves as possible. What’s real about that?\n\nPASSAGE 2\n\nWhy does Reality TV get such a bad rap? Editorials on the subject blame its popularity on everything from the degenerate morals of today’s youth to our ever-decreasing attention spans. The truth is that reality-based programs have been around for decades. Candid Camera first aired in 1948, a “Cops”-like show called Wanted was on CBS’s lineup in the mid-1950s, and PBS aired a controversial 12–hour documentary filmed inside a family’s home in 1973. But it was Survivor, which debuted on American TV in the summer of 2000, which spawned the immense popularity of the “reality” genre. There are now more than 40 reality shows on the air, and, hinting that they are here to stay, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences added “Best Reality Show” as an Emmy category in 2002.\n\nWhy are these shows so popular today? Are they really a sign that our morals, and our minds, are on a decline? People have been tuning in to Reality TV for generations, so what makes today’s shows any worse than their predecessors? Let’s look at a number of current, popular shows to see what the fuss is about. MTV’s The Real World has been on the air for over ten years. It places seven strangers in one house and tapes them as they live together for a few months. The show has been a ratings homerun for MTV, and tens of thousands of hopefuls audition each time they announce they are producing another show. Those who make the cut are attractive young singles not only looking for a good time, but also looking for fame, too. It’s not uncommon for them to hire a show business agent before the taping starts.\n\nOther Reality shows take fame-seekers to the next level by having them compete against one another. American Idol, Star Search, and Fame showcase singers, actors, dancers, and model wannabes, and offer them a chance at professional success. Even those who don’t win the big prize get national television exposure, and have a better chance than they did before the show of becoming famous. Survivor offers another twist: not only can you become an instant celebrity, but you have a chance to win a million dollars. The combination of fame and money has helped to make Survivor the most popular Reality TV program of all time. But it’s not alone in the format. Big Brother combines the “group living together in a beautiful setting” concept of The Real World with a $500,000 prize, and Fear Factor pays $50,000 to the contestant who completes the most terrifying stunts.\n\nGiven television’s long history of reality-based programming, why is there a problem now? Most Reality TV centers on two common motivators: fame and money. The shows have pulled waitresses, hair stylists, investment bankers, and counselors, to name a few, from obscurity to household names. These lucky few successfully parlayed their fifteen minutes of fame into celebrity. Even if you are not interested in fame, you can probably understand the desire for lots of money. Watching people eat large insects, jump off cliffs, and be filmed 24 hours a day for a huge financial reward makes for interesting viewing. What’s wrong with people wanting to be rich and famous? Not much, and, if you don’t like it, you can always change the channel.",

    passage: "In 1904, the U.S. Patent Office granted a patent for a board game called “The Landlord’s Game,” which was invented by a Virginia Quaker named Lizzie Magie. Magie was a follower of Henry George, who started a tax movement that supported the theory that the renting of land and real estate produced an unearned increase in land values that profited a few individuals (landlords) rather than the majority of the people (tenants). George proposed a single federal tax based on land ownership; he believed this tax would weaken the ability to form monopolies, encourage equal opportunity, and narrow the gap between rich and poor.\n\nLizzie Magie wanted to spread the word about George’s proposal, making it more understandable to a majority of people who were basically unfamiliar with economics. As a result, she invented a board game that would serve as a teaching device. The Landlord’s Game was intended to explain the evils of monopolies, showing that they repressed the possibility for equal opportunity. Her instructions read in part: “The object of this game is not only to afford amusement to players, but to illustrate to them how, under the present or prevailing system of land tenure, the landlord has an advantage over other enterprisers, and also how the single tax would discourage speculation.”\n\nThe board for the game was painted with forty spaces around its perimeter, including four railroads, two utilities, twenty-two rental properties, and a jail. There were other squares directing players to go to jail, pay a luxury tax, and park. All properties were available for rent, rather than purchase. Magie’s invention became very popular, spreading through word of mouth, and altering slightly as it did. Since it was not manufactured by Magie, the boards and game pieces were homemade. Rules were explained and transmuted, from one group of friends to another. There is evidence to suggest that The Landlord’s Game was played at Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1924, Magie approached George Parker (President of Parker Brothers) to see if he was interested in purchasing the rights to her game. Parker turned her down, saying that it was too political. The game increased in popularity, migrating north to New York state, west to Michigan, and as far south as Texas. By the early 1930s, it reached Charles Darrow in Philadelphia. In 1935, claiming to be the inventor, Darrow got a patent for the game, and approached Parker Brothers. This time, the company loved it, swallowed Darrow’s prevarication, and not only purchased his patent, but paid him royalties for every game sold. The game quickly became Parker Brothers’ bestseller, and made the company, and Darrow, millions of dollars.\n\nWhen Parker Brothers found out that Darrow was not the true inventor of the game, they wanted to protect their rights to the successful game, so they went back to Lizzie Magie, now Mrs. Elizabeth Magie Phillips of Clarendon, Virginia. She agreed to a payment of $500 for her patent, with no royalties, so she could stay true to the original intent of her game’s invention. She therefore required in return that Parker Brothers manufacture and market The Landlord’s Game in addition to Monopoly. However, only a few hundred games were ever produced. Monopoly went on to become the world’s best-selling board game, with an objective that is the exact opposite of the one Magie intended: “The idea of the game is to buy and rent or sell property so profitably that one becomes the wealthiest player and eventually monopolist. The game is one of shrewd and amusing trading and excitement.”",

    passage: "In the past thirty years, Americans’ consumption of restaurant and take-out food has doubled. The result, according to many health watchdog groups, is an increase in overweight and obesity. Almost 60 million Americans are obese, costing $117 billion each year in health care and related costs. Members of Congress have decided they need to do something about the obesity epidemic. A bill was recently introduced in the House that would require restaurants with twenty or more locations to list the nutritional content of their food on their menus. A Senate version of the bill is expected in the near future.\n\nOur legislators point to the trend of restaurants’ marketing larger meals at attractive prices. People order these meals believing that they are getting a great value, but what they are also getting could be, in one meal, more than the daily recommended allowances of calories, fat, and sodium. The question is, would people stop “supersizing,” or make other healthier choices if they knew the nutritional content of the food they’re ordering? Lawmakers think they would, and the gravity of the obesity problem has caused them to act to change menus.\n\nThe Menu Education and Labeling, or MEAL, Act, would result in menus that look like the nutrition facts panels found on food in supermarkets. Those panels are required by the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which exempted restaurants. The new restaurant menus would list calories, fat, and sodium on printed menus, and calories on menu boards, for all items that are offered on a regular basis (daily specials don’t apply). But isn’t this simply asking restaurants to state the obvious? Who isn’t aware that an order of supersize fries isn’t health food? Does anyone order a double cheeseburger thinking they’re being virtuous?\n\nStudies have shown that it’s not that simple. In one, registered dieticians couldn’t come up with accurate estimates of the calories found in certain fast foods. Who would have guessed that a milk shake, which sounds pretty healthy (it does contain milk, after all) has more calories than three McDonald’s cheeseburgers? Or that one chain’s chicken breast sandwich, another better-sounding alternative to a burger, contains more than half a day’s calories and twice the recommended daily amount of sodium? Even a fast-food coffee drink, without a doughnut to go with it, has almost half the calories needed in a day.\n\nThe restaurant industry isn’t happy about the new bill. Arguments against it include the fact that diet alone is not the reason for America’s obesity epidemic. A lack of adequate exercise is also to blame. In addition, many fast food chains already post nutritional information on their websites, or on posters located in their restaurants.\n\nThose who favor the MEAL Act, and similar legislation, say in response that we must do all we can to help people maintain a healthy weight. While the importance of exercise is undeniable, the quantity and quality of what we eat must be changed. They believe that if we want consumers to make better choices when they eat out, nutritional information must be provided where they are selecting their food. Restaurant patrons are not likely to have memorized the calorie counts they may have looked up on the Internet, nor are they going to leave their tables, or a line, to check out a poster that might be on the opposite side of the restaurant.",

    passage: "“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,” stated Chief Justice John Marshall in a unanimous opinion in the 1803 Supreme Court case of Marbury v. Madison. This landmark case established the doctrine of judicial review, which gives the court the authority to declare executive actions and laws invalid if they conflict with the U.S. Constitution. The court’s ruling on the constitutionality of a law is nearly final—it can only be overcome by a constitutional amendment or by a new ruling of the court. Through the power of judicial review, the court shapes the development of law, assures individual rights, and maintains the Constitution as a “living” document by applying its broad provisions to complex new situations.\n\nDespite the court’s role in interpreting the Constitution, the document itself does not grant this authority to the court. However, it is clear that several of the founding fathers expected the Court to act in this way. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison argued for the importance of judicial review in the Federalist Papers, a series of 85 political essays that urged the adoption of the Constitution. Hamilton argued that judicial review protected the will of the people by making the Constitution supreme over the legislature, which might only reflect the temporary will of the people. Madison wrote that if a public political process determined the constitutionality of laws, the Constitution would become fodder for political interests and partisanship. However, the practice of judicial review was, and continues to be, a controversial power because it gives justices—who are appointed rather than elected by the people—the authority to void legislation made by Congress and state lawmakers.",

    passage: "Almost from the beginning of his administration, Lincoln was pressured by abolitionists and radical Republicans to issue an Emancipation Proclamation. In principle, Lincoln approved, but he postponed action against slavery until he believed he had wider support from the American public. The passage of the Second Confiscation Act by Congress on July 17, 1862, which freed the slaves of everyone in rebellion against the government, provided the desired signal. Not only had Congress relieved the Administration of considerable strain with its limited initiative on emancipation, it demonstrated an increasing public abhorrence toward slavery. Lincoln had already drafted what he termed his “Preliminary Proclamation.” He read his initial draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to Secretaries William H. Seward and Gideon Welles on July 13, 1862. For a moment, both secretaries were speechless. Quickly collecting his thoughts, Seward said something about anarchy in the South and possible foreign intervention, but with Welles apparently too confused to respond, Lincoln let the matter drop.\n\nNine days later, on July 22, Lincoln raised the issue in a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting. The reaction was mixed. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, correctly interpreting the Proclamation as a military measure designed both to deprive the Confederacy of slave labor and bring additional men into the Union Army, advocated its immediate release. Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase was equally supportive, but Montgomery Blair, the Postmaster General, foresaw defeat in the fall elections. Attorney General Edward Bates, a conservative, opposed civil and political equality for blacks but gave his qualified support. Fortunately, President Lincoln only wanted the advice of his Cabinet on the style of the Proclamation, not its substance. The course was set. The Cabinet meeting of September 22, 1862, resulted in the political and literary refinement of the July draft, and on January 1, 1863, Lincoln composed the final Emancipation Proclamation. It was the crowning achievement of his administration.",

    passage: "A mainstay of American newspapers since the early nineteenth century, political cartoons use graphic art to comment on current events in a way that will inform, amuse, provoke, poke, and persuade readers. Cartoons take on the principal issues and leaders of the day, skewering hypocritical or corrupt politicians and depicting the ridiculous, the ironic, or the serious nature of a major event in a single, deftly drawn image. Cartoons use few words, if any, to convey their message. Some use caricature, a technique in which a cartoonist exaggerates the features of well-known people to make fun of them. (Think of renderings of Bill Clinton with a nose redder than Rudolph’s and swollen out of proportion, or cartoons of George W. Bush’s exaggerated pointy visage sporting a ten-gallon cowboy hat.)\n\nBecause they have the ability to evoke an emotional response in readers, political cartoons can serve as a vehicle for swaying public opinion and can contribute to reform. Thomas Nast (1840–1902), the preeminent political cartoonist of the second half of the nineteenth century, demonstrated the power of his medium when he used his art to end the corrupt Boss Tweed Ring in New York City. His images, first drawn for Harper’s Weekly, are still in currency today: Nast created the tiger as the symbol of Tammany Hall, the elephant for the Republican Party, and the donkey for the Democratic Party.

    passage: "The post-World War II era marked a period of unprecedented energy against the second-class citizenship accorded to African Americans in many parts of the nation. Resistance to racial segregation and discrimination with strategies like those described above—civil disobedience, nonviolent resistance, marches, protests, boycotts, “freedom rides,” and rallies—received national attention as newspaper, radio, and television reporters and cameramen documented the struggle to end racial inequality.\n\nWhen Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person in Montgomery, Alabama, and was arrested in December 1955, she set off a train of events that generated a momentum the civil rights movement had never before experienced. Local civil rights leaders were hoping for such an opportunity to test the city’s segregation laws. Deciding to boycott the buses, the African-American community soon formed a new organization to supervise the boycott, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA). The young pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., was chosen as the first MIA leader. The boycott, more successful than anyone hoped, led to a 1956 Supreme Court decision banning segregated buses.\n\nIn 1960, four black freshmen from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro strolled into the F. W. Woolworth store and quietly sat down at the lunch counter. They were not served, but they stayed until closing time. The next morning they came with twenty-five more students. Two weeks later similar demonstrations had spread to several cities, within a year similar peaceful demonstrations took place in over a hundred cities North and South. At Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, the students formed their own organization, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced “Snick”). The students’ bravery in the face of verbal and physical abuse led to integration in many stores even before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe August 28, 1963, March on Washington riveted the nation’s attention. Rather than the anticipated hundred thousand marchers, more than twice that number appeared, astonishing even its organizers. Blacks and whites, side by side, called on President John F. Kennedy and the Congress to provide equal access to public facilities, quality education, adequate employment, and decent housing for African Americans. During the assembly at the Lincoln Memorial, the young preacher who had led the successful Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a stirring message with the refrain, “I Have a Dream.”\n\nThere were also continuing efforts to legally challenge segregation through the courts. Success crowned these efforts: the Brown decision in 1954, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act in 1965 helped bring about the demise of the entangling web of legislation that bound blacks to second class citizenship. One hundred years after the Civil War, blacks and their white allies still pursued the battle for equal rights in every area of American life. While there is more to achieve in ending discrimination, major milestones in civil rights laws are on the books for the purpose of regulating equal access to public accommodations, equal justice before the law, and equal employment, education, and housing opportunities. African Americans have had unprecedented openings in many fields of learning and in the arts. The black struggle for civil rights also inspired other liberation and rights movements, including those of Native Americans, Latinos, and women, and African Americans have lent their support to liberation struggles in Africa.",

    passage: "While the Chinese, in particular those working as sailors, knew the west coast of North America before the Gold Rush, our story begins in 1850, as the documentation from the Gold Rush provides the starting point with which to build a more substantial narrative. Most Chinese immigrants entered California through the port of San Francisco. From San Francisco and other ports, many sought their fortunes in other parts of California. The Chinese formed part of the diverse gathering of peoples from throughout the world who contributed to the economic and population explosion that characterized the early history of the state of California. The Chinese who emigrated to the United States at this time were part of a larger exodus from southeast China searching for better economic opportunities and fleeing a situation of political corruption and decline. Most immigrants came from the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong (Canton) Province.\n\nChinese immigrants proved to be productive and resourceful contributors to a multitude of industries and businesses. The initial group of Chinese argonauts sought their livelihood in the gold mines, calling California Gam Saan, Gold Mountain. For the mining industry, they built many of the flumes and roads, allowing for easier access and processing of the minerals being extracted. Chinese immigrants faced discrimination immediately upon arrival in California. In mining, they were forced to work older claims, or to work for others. In the 1850s, the United States Constitution reserved the right of naturalization for white immigrants to this country. Thus, Chinese immigrants lived at the whim of local governments with some allowed to become naturalized citizens, but most not. Without this right, it was difficult to pursue livelihoods. For example, Chinese immigrants were unable to own land or file mining claims. Also in the 1850s, the California legislature passed a law taxing all foreign miners. Although stated in general terms, it was enforced chiefly against the Mexicans and the Chinese through 1870. This discrimination occurred in spite of the fact that the Chinese often contributed the crucial labor necessary to the mining enterprise.\n\nDiscriminatory legislation forced many Chinese out of the gold fields and into low-paying, menial, and often arduous jobs. In many cases, they took on the most dangerous and least desirable components of work available. They worked on reclaiming marshes in the Central Valley so that the land could become agriculturally productive. They built the stone bridges and fences, constructed roads, and excavated storage areas for the wine industry in Napa and Sonoma counties. The most impressive construction feat of Chinese Americans was their work on the western section of the transcontinental railroad. Chinese-American workers laid much of the tracks for the Central Pacific Railroad through the foothills and over the high Sierra Nevada, much of which involved hazardous work with explosives to tunnel through the hills. Their speed, dexterity, and outright perseverance, often in brutally cold temperatures and heavy snow through two record breaking winters, is a testimony to their outstanding achievements and contributions to opening up the West.",

    id: "passage-14-textile-mills",
    passage: "The mounting conflict between the colonies and England in the 1760s and 1770s reinforced a growing conviction that Americans should be less dependent on their mother country for manufactures. Spinning bees and bounties encouraged the manufacture of homespun cloth as a substitute for English imports. But manufacturing of cloth outside the household was associated with relief of the poor. In Boston and Philadelphia, Houses of Industry employed poor families at spinning for their daily bread.\n\nSuch practices made many pre-Revolutionary Americans dubious about manufacturing. After independence there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to establish textile factories. Americans needed access to the British industrial innovations, but England had passed laws forbidding the export of machinery or the emigration of those who could operate it. Nevertheless it was an English immigrant, Samuel Slater, who finally introduced British cotton technology to America.\n\nSlater had worked his way up from apprentice to overseer in an English factory using the Arkwright system. Drawn by American bounties for the introduction of textile technology, he passed as a farmer and sailed for America with details of the Arkwright water frame committed to memory. In December 1790, working for mill owner Moses Brown, he started up the first permanent American cotton spinning mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Employing a workforce of nine children between the ages of seven and twelve, Slater successfully mechanized the carding and spinning processes.\n\nA generation of millwrights and textile workers trained under Slater was the catalyst for the rapid proliferation of textile mills in the early nineteenth century. From Slater’s first mill, the industry spread across New England to places like North Uxbridge, Massachusetts. For two decades, before Lowell mills and those modeled after them offered competition, the “Rhode Island System” of small, rural spinning mills set the tone for early industrialization.\n\nBy 1800 the mill employed more than 100 workers. A decade later 61 cotton mills turning more than 31,000 spindles were operating in the United States, with Rhode Island and the Philadelphia region the main manufacturing centers. The textile industry was established, although factory operations were limited to carding and spinning. It remained for Francis Cabot Lowell to introduce a workable power loom and the integrated factory, in which all textile production steps take place under one roof.\n\nAs textile mills proliferated after the turn of the century, a national debate arose over the place of manufacturing in American society. Thomas Jefferson spoke for those supporting the “yeoman ideal” of a rural Republic, at whose heart was the independent, democratic farmer. He questioned the spread of factories, worrying about factory workers’ loss of economic independence. Alexander Hamilton led those who promoted manufacturing and saw prosperity growing out of industrial development. The debate, largely philosophical in the 1790s, grew more urgent after 1830 as textile factories multiplied and increasing numbers of Americans worked in them.",

    id: "passage-15-great-depression",
    passage: "The worst and longest economic crisis in the modern industrial world, the Great Depression in the United States had devastating consequences for American society. At its lowest depth (1932–33), more than 16 million people were unemployed, more than 5,000 banks had closed, and over 85,000 businesses had failed. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, their savings, and even their homes. The homeless built shacks for temporary shelter—these emerging shantytowns were nicknamed “Hoovervilles,” a bitter homage to President Herbert Hoover, who refused to give government assistance to the jobless. Farmers were hit especially hard. A severe drought coupled with the economic crisis ruined small farms throughout the Great Plains as productive farmland turned to dust and crop prices dropped by 50%. The effects of the American depression—severe unemployment rates and a sharp drop in the production and sales of goods—could also be felt abroad, where many European nations were still struggling to recover from World War I.\n\nAlthough the stock market crash of 1929 marked the onset of the depression, it was not the cause of it: deep underlying fissures already existed in the economy of America’s Roaring Twenties. For example, the tariff and war-debt policies after World War I contributed to the instability of the banking system. American banks made loans to European countries following World War I. However, the United States kept high tariffs on goods imported from other nations. These policies worked against one another: If other countries could not sell goods in the United States, they could not make enough money to pay back their loans or to buy American goods.\n\nAnd while the United States seemed to be enjoying a prosperous period in the 1920s, the wealth was not evenly distributed. Businesses made gains in productivity, but only one segment of the population—the wealthy—reaped large profits. Workers received only a small share of the wealth they helped produce. At the same time, Americans spent more than they earned. Advertising encouraged Americans to buy cars, radios, and household appliances instead of saving or purchasing only what they could afford. Easy credit polices allowed consumers to borrow money and accumulate debt. Investors also wildly speculated on the stock market, often borrowing money on credit to buy shares of a company. Stocks increased beyond their worth, but investors were willing to pay inflated prices because they believed stocks would continue to rise. This bubble burst in the fall of 1929, when investors lost confidence that stock prices would keep rising. As investors sold off stocks, the market spiraled downward. The stock market crash affected the economy in the same way that a stressful event can affect the human body, lowering its resistance to infection.\n\nThe ensuing depression led to the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt introduced relief measures that would revive the economy and bring needed relief to Americans who were suffering the effects of the depression. In his first hundred days in office, Roosevelt and Congress passed major legislation that saved banks from closing and regained public confidence. These measures, called the New Deal, included the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid farmers to slow their production in order to stabilize food prices; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured bank deposits in the case that banks fail; and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulated the stock market. Although the New Deal offered relief, it did not end the depression. The economy sagged until the nation entered World War II. However, the New Deal changed the relationship between government and American citizens, by expanding the role of the central government in regulating the economy and creating social assistance programs.",

    passage: "When Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark into the West, he patterned their mission on the methods of Enlightenment science: to observe, collect, document, and classify. Such strategies were already in place for the epic voyages made by explorers like Cook and Vancouver. Like their contemporaries, Lewis and Clark were more than representatives of European rationalism. They also represented a rising American empire, one built on aggressive territorial expansion and commercial gain.\n\nBut there was another view of the West: that of the native inhabitants of the land. Their understandings of landscapes, peoples, and resources formed both a contrast and counterpoint to those of Jefferson’s travelers. One of Lewis and Clark’s missions was to open diplomatic relations between the United States and the Native American nations of the West. As Jefferson told Lewis, “it will now be proper you should inform those through whose country you will pass . . . that henceforth we become their fathers and friends.” When Euro-Americans and Native Americans met, they used ancient diplomatic protocols that included formal language, ceremonial gifts, and displays of military power. But behind these symbols and rituals there were often very different ways of understanding power and authority. Such differences sometimes made communication across the cultural divide difficult and open to confusion and misunderstanding.\n\nAn important organizing principle in Euro-American society was hierarchy. Both soldiers and civilians had complex gradations of rank to define who gave orders and who obeyed. While kinship was important in the Euro-American world, it was even more fundamental in tribal societies. Everyone’s power and place depended on a complex network of real and symbolic relationships. When the two groups met—whether for trade or diplomacy—each tried to reshape the other in their own image. Lewis and Clark sought to impose their own notions of hierarchy on Native Americans by “making chiefs” with medals, printed certificates, and gifts. Native people tried to impose the obligations of kinship on the visitors by means of adoption ceremonies, shared names, and ritual gifts.\n\nThe American republic began to issue peace medals during the first Washington administration, continuing a tradition established by the European nations. Lewis and Clark brought at least eighty-nine medals in five sizes in order to designate five “ranks” of chief. In the eyes of Americans, Native Americans who accepted such medals were also acknowledging American sovereignty as “children” of a new “great father.” And in a moment of imperial bravado, Lewis hung a peace medal around the neck of a Piegan Blackfeet warrior killed by the expedition in late July 1806. As Lewis later explained, he used a peace medal as a way to let the Blackfeet know “who we were.”\n\nIn tribal society, kinship was like a legal system—people depended on relatives to protect them from crime, war, and misfortune. People with no kin were outside of society and its rules. To adopt Lewis and Clark into tribal society, the Plains Indians used a pipe ceremony. The ritual of smoking and sharing the pipe was at the heart of much Native American diplomacy. With the pipe the captains accepted sacred obligations to share wealth, aid in war, and revenge injustice. At the end of the ceremony, the pipe was presented to them so they would never forget their obligations.\n\nGift giving was an essential part of diplomacy. To Native Americans, gifts proved the giver’s sincerity and honored the tribe. To Lewis and Clark, some gifts advertised the technological superiority and others encouraged the Native Americans to adopt an agrarian lifestyle. Like salesmen handing out free samples, Lewis and Clark packed bales of manufactured goods to open diplomatic relations with Native American tribes. Jefferson advised Lewis to give out corn mills to introduce the Native Americans to mechanized agriculture as part of his plan to “civilize and instruct” them. Clark believed the mills were “verry Thankfully recived,” but by the next year the Mandan had demolished theirs to use the metal for weapons.",

    passage: "PASSAGE 1\n\nFirst let me speak of the constitution of the United States, and assert that there is not a line in it, nor a word, forbidding women to vote; but, properly interpreted, that is, interpreted by the Declaration of Independence, and by the assertions of the Fathers, it actually guarantees to women the right to vote in all elections, both state and national.\nListen to the preamble to the constitution, and the preamble you know, is the key to what follows; it is the concrete, general statement of the great principles which subsequent articles express in detail. The preamble says: “We, The People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”\nCommit this to memory, friends; learn it by heart as well as by head, and I should have no need to argue the question before you of my right to vote. For women are “people” surely, and desire, as much as men, to say the least, to establish justice and to insure domestic tranquility; and, brothers, you will never insure domestic tranquility in the days to come unless you allow women to vote, who pay taxes and bear equally with yourselves all the burdens of society; for they do not mean any longer to submit patiently and quietly to such injustice, and the sooner men understand this and graciously submit to become the political equals of their mothers, wives, and daughters—aye, of their grandmothers, for that is my category, instead of their political masters, as they now are, the sooner will this precious domestic tranquility be insured. Women are surely “people,” I said, and were when these words were written, and were as anxious as men to establish justice and promote the general welfare, and no one will have the hardihood to deny that our foremothers (have we not talked about our forefathers alone long enough?) did their full share in the work of establishing justice, providing for the common defense, and promoting the general welfare in all those early days.\nThe truth is, friends, that when liberties had to be gained by the sword and protected by the sword, men necessarily came to the front and seemed to be the only creators and defenders of these liberties; hence all the way down women have been content to do their patriotic work silently and through men, who are the fighters by nature rather than themselves, until the present day; but now at last, when it is established that ballots instead of bullets are to rule the world . . . now, it is high time that women ceased to attempt to establish justice and promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity, through the votes of men . . .\n\nPASSAGE 2\n\nThis proposed amendment forbids the United States or any State to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of sex. If adopted, it will make several millions of female voters, totally inexperienced in political affairs, quite generally dependent upon the other sex, all incapable of performing military duty and without the power to enforce the laws which their numerical strength may enable them to make, and comparatively very few of whom wish to assume the irksome and responsible political duties which this measure thrusts upon them.\nAn experiment so novel, a change so great, should only be made slowly and in response to a general public demand, of the existence of which there is no evidence before your committee. Petitions from various parts of the country, containing by estimate about 30,000 names, have been presented to Congress asking for this legislation. They were procured through the efforts of woman-suffrage societies, thoroughly organized, with active and zealous managers. The ease with which signatures may be procured to any petition is well known. The small number of petitioners, when compared with that of the intelligent women in the country, is striking evidence that there exists among them no general desire to take up the heavy burden of governing, which so many men seek to evade. It would be unjust, unwise, and impolitic to impose that burden on the great mass of women throughout the country who do not wish for it, to gratify the comparatively few who do.\nIt has been strongly urged that without the right of suffrage women are and will be subjected to great oppression and injustice. But everyone who has examined the subject at all knows that without female suffrage, legislation for years has improved and is still improving the condition of women. The disabilities imposed upon her by the common law have, one by one, been swept away until in most of the States she has the full right to her property and all, or nearly all the rights which can be granted without impairing or destroying the marriage relation. These changes have been wrought by the spirit of the age, and are not, generally at least, the result of any agitation by women in their own behalf.\nNor can women justly complain of any partiality in the administration of justice. They have the sympathy of judges and particularly of juries to an extent which would warrant loud complaint on the part of their adversaries of the sterner sex. Their appeals to legislatures against injustice are never unheeded, and there is no doubt that when any considerable part of the women of any State really wish for the right to vote it will be granted without the intervention of Congress.\nAny State may grant the right of suffrage to women. Some of them have done so to a limited extent, and perhaps with good results. It is evident that in some States public opinion is much more strongly in favor of it than it is in others. Your committee regards it as unwise and inexpedient to enable three-fourths in number of the States, through an amendment to the National Constitution, to force woman suffrage upon the other fourth in which the public opinion of both sexes may be strongly adverse to such a change.\nFor these reasons, your committee reports back said resolution with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.",

The paths wind, the landscape constantly shifts and changes, the sections spill into one another in a seemingly random manner. But this “decentering” was precisely the intent of the park’s innovative design. Made to look as natural as possible, Frederick Law Olmsted’s 1858 plan for Central Park had as its main goal the creation of a democratic playground—a place with many centers to reflect the multiplicity of its uses and users. Olmsted designed the park to allow interaction among the various members of society, without giving preference to one group or class.

Of these, we call the goods pertaining to the soul goods in the highest and fullest sense. But in speaking of “soul,” we refer to our soul’s actions and activities. Thus, our definition [of good] tallies with this opinion which has been current for a long time and to which philosophers subscribe. We are also right in defining the end as consisting of actions and activities; for in this way the end is included among the goods of the soul and not among external goods.\n\nAlso the view that a happy man lives well and fares well fits in with our definition: for we have all but defined happiness as a kind of good life and well-being.\n\nMoreover, the characteristics which one looks for in happiness are all included in our definition.

    id: "passage-20-utilitarianism",
    passage: "If you have ever made a list of pros and cons to help you make a decision, you have used the utilitarian method of moral reasoning. One of the main ethical theories, utilitarianism posits that the key to deciding what makes an act morally right or wrong is its consequences.\n\nWhether our intentions are good or bad is irrelevant; what matters is whether the result of our actions is good or bad. To utilitarians, happiness is the ultimate goal of human beings and the highest moral good. Thus, if there is great unhappiness because of an act, then that action can be said to be morally wrong. If, on the other hand, there is great happiness because of an action, then that act can be said to be morally right.\n\nUtilitarians believe that we should carefully weigh the potential consequences of an action before we take it. Will the act lead to things that will make us, or others, happy? Will it make us, or others, unhappy? According to utilitarians, we should choose to do that which creates the greatest amount of good (happiness) for the greatest number of people. This can be difficult to determine, though, because sometimes an act can create short-term happiness but misery in the long term. Another problematic aspect of utilitarianism is that it deems it acceptable—indeed, even necessary—to use another person as a means to an end and sacrifice the happiness of one or a few for the happiness of many.",

    passage: "I have said that all branches of knowledge are connected together, because the subject-matter of knowledge is intimately united in itself [ . . . ]. Hence it is that the Sciences, into which our knowledge may be said to be cast, have multiple bearings on one another, and an internal sympathy, and admit, or rather demand, comparison and adjustment. They complete, correct, and balance each other. This consideration, if well-founded, must be taken into account, not only as regards the attainment of truth, which is their common end, but as regards the influence which they excise upon those whose education consists in the study of them. I have already said, that to give undue prominence to one is to be unjust to another; to neglect or supersede these is to divert those from their proper object. It is to unsettle the boundary lines between science and science, to disturb their action, to destroy the harmony which binds them together. Such a proceeding will have a corresponding effect when introduced into a place of education. There is no science but tells a different tale, when viewed as a portion of a whole, from what it is likely to suggest when taken by itself, without the safeguard, as I may call it, of others.\n\nLet me make use of an illustration. In the combination of colors, very different effects are produced by a difference in their selection and juxtaposition; red, green, and white, change their shades, according to the contrast to which they are submitted. And, in like manner, the drift and meaning of a branch of knowledge varies with the company in which it is introduced to the student. If his reading is confined simply to one subject, however such division of labor may favor the advancement of a particular pursuit, a point into which I do not here enter, certainly it has a tendency to contract his mind. If it is incorporated with others, it depends on those others as to the kind of influence that it exerts upon him. Thus the Classics, which in England are the means of refining the taste, have in France subserved the spread of revolutionary and deistical doctrines. [ . . . .] In a like manner, I suppose, Arcesilas would not have handled logic as Aristotle, nor Aristotle have criticized poets as Plato; yet reasoning and poetry are subject to scientific rules.\n\nIt is a great point then to enlarge the range of studies which a University professes, even for the sake of the students; and, though they cannot pursue every subject which is open to them, they will be the gainers by living among those and under those who represent the whole circle. This I conceive to be the advantage of a seat of universal learning, considered as a place of education. An assemblage of learned men, zealous for their own sciences, and rivals of each other, are brought, by familiar intercourse and for the sake of intellectual peace, to adjust together the claims and relations of their respective subjects of investigation. They learn to respect, to consult, to aid each other. Thus is created a pure and clear atmosphere of thought, which the student also breathes, though in his own case he only pursues a few sciences out of the multitude. He profits by an intellectual tradition, which is independent of particular teachers, which guides him in his choice of subjects, and duly interprets for him those which he chooses. He apprehends the great outlines of knowledge, the principles on which it rests, the scale of its parts, its lights and its shades, its great points and its little, as he otherwise cannot apprehend them. Hence it is that his education is called “Liberal.” A habit of mind is formed which lasts through life, of which the attributes are, freedom, equitableness, calmness, moderation, and wisdom; or what in a former discourse I have ventured to call a philosophical habit. This then I would assign as the special fruit of the education furnished at a University, as contrasted with other places of teaching or modes of teaching. This is the main purpose of a University in its treatment of its students.",

    id: "passage-22-panopticon",
    passage: "A recent New York Times “House and Home” article featured the story of a man who lives in a glass house. Every wall in his home is transparent; he has no walls to hide behind, not even in the bathroom. Of course, he lives in an isolated area, so he doesn’t exactly have neighbors peering in and watching his every move. But he has chosen to live without any physical privacy in a home that allows every action to be seen. He has created his own panopticon of sorts, a place in which everything is in full view of others.\n\nThe term panopticon was coined by Jeremy Bentham in the late eighteenth century when he was describing an idea for how prisons should be designed. The prisoner’s cells would be placed in a circle with a guard tower in the middle. All walls facing the center of the circle would be glass. In that way, every prisoner’s cell would be in full view of the guards. The prisoners could do nothing unobserved, but the prisoners would not be able to see the guard tower. They would know they were being watched—or rather, they would know that they could be being watched—but because they could not see the observer, they would never know when the guard was actually monitoring their actions.\n\nIt is common knowledge that people behave differently when they know they are being watched. We act differently when we know someone is looking; we act differently when we think someone else might be looking. In these situations, we are less likely to be ourselves; instead, we will act the way we think we should act when we are being observed by others.\n\nIn our wired society, many talk of the panopticon as a metaphor for the future. But in many ways, the panopticon is already here. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, and we often don’t even know our actions are being recorded. In fact, the surveillance camera industry is enormous, and these cameras keep getting smaller and smaller to make surveillance easier and more ubiquitous. In addition, we leave a record of everything we do online; our cyber-whereabouts can be tracked and that information used for various purposes. Every time we use a credit card, make a major purchase, answer a survey, apply for a loan, or join a mailing list, our actions are observed and recorded. And most of us have no idea just how much information about us has been recorded and how much data is available to various sources. The scale of information gathering and the scale of exchange have both expanded so rapidly in the last decade that there are now millions of electronic profiles of individuals existing in cyberspace, profiles that are bought and sold, traded, and often used for important decisions, such as whether or not to grant someone a loan. However, that information is essentially beyond our control. We can do little to stop the information gathering and exchange and can only hope to be able to control the damage if something goes wrong.\n\nSomething went wrong recently for me. Someone obtained my Social Security number, address, work number and address, and a few other vital pieces of data. That person then applied for a credit account in my name. The application was approved, and I soon received a bill for nearly $5,000 worth of computer-related purchases.\n\nFraud, of course, is a different issue, but this kind of fraud couldn’t happen—or at least, couldn’t happen with such ease and frequency—in a world of paper-based records. With so much information floating about in cyberspace, and so much technology that can record and observe, our privacy has been deeply compromised.\n\nI find it truly amazing that someone would want to live in a transparent house at any time, but especially in an age when individual privacy is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and defend (against those who argue that information must be gathered for the social good). Or perhaps this man’s house is an attempt to call our attention to the fact that the panopticon is already here, and that we are all just as exposed as he is.",

The passage also expresses great concern for the lack of control over information in cyberspace (paragraph 4), stating that we can only hope to be able to control the damage if something goes wrong (line 44–45).

    passage: "Without a doubt, one of the most interesting mythological characters is the Greek god Prometheus. A complex character with an undying love for the human beings he created, Prometheus embodies a rich combination of often contradictory characteristics, including loyalty and defiance, trickery and trustworthiness. He shows resilience and resolve in his actions yet weakness in his fondness for humankind.\n\nTo reward Prometheus (whose name means “forethought”) and his brother Epimetheus (“afterthought”) for helping him defeat the Titans, Zeus, the great ruler of Olympian gods, gave the brothers the task of creating mortals to populate the land around Mount Olympus. Prometheus asked Epimetheus to give the creatures their various characteristics, such as cunning, swiftness, and flight. By the time he got to man, however, there was nothing left to give. So Prometheus decided to make man in his image: he stood man upright like the gods and became the benefactor and protector of mankind.\n\nThough Prometheus was particularly fond of his creation, Zeus didn’t care for mankind and didn’t want men to have the divine gift of knowledge. But Prometheus took pity on mortal men and gave them knowledge of the arts and sciences, including the healing arts and agriculture.\n\nAlways seeking the best for his creation, one day Prometheus conspired to trick Zeus to give the best meat of an ox to men instead of Zeus. He cut up the ox and hid the bones in layers of fat; then he hid the meat and innards inside the hide. When Prometheus presented the piles to Zeus, Zeus chose the pile that looked like fat and meat. He was enraged to find that it was nothing but bones.\n\nTo punish Prometheus for his deceit and his fondness for humans, Zeus forbade men fire—a symbol of creative power, life force, and divine knowledge. But Prometheus would not let his children be denied this greatest of gifts. He took a hollow reed, stole fire from Mount Olympus, and gave it to man. With this divine power, creativity, ingenuity, and culture flourished in the land of mortals.\n\nAgain Zeus punished man for Prometheus’s transgression, this time by sending the first woman, Pandora, to Earth. Pandora brought with her a “gift” from Zeus: a jar filled with evils of every kind. Prometheus knew Zeus to be vengeful and warned Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus, but Epimetheus was too taken with Pandora’s beauty and allowed her to stay. Eventually Pandora opened the jar she’d been forbidden to open, releasing all manner of evils, including Treachery, Sorrow, Villainy, Misfortune, and Plague. At the bottom of the jar was Hope, but Pandora closed the lid before Hope could escape.\n\nPrometheus drew Zeus’s greatest wrath when he refused to tell Zeus which of Zeus’s sons would kill him and take over the throne. Believing he could torture Prometheus into revealing the secret, Zeus bound Prometheus to a rock where every day an eagle would come to tear at his flesh and eat his liver, which would regenerate each night. But Prometheus refused to reveal his knowledge of the future to Zeus and maintained his silence. Eventually, Prometheus was released by Heracles (also known as Hercules), the last mortal son of Zeus and the strongest of all mortals. Soon afterwards, Prometheus received immortality from a dying centaur, to take his place forever among the great gods of Olympus.",

    passage: "The following passage describes an influential group of nineteenth century painters.\n\nWhen one thinks of student-led rebellions and the changes they can create, one typically thinks of the struggles of the twentieth century, such as the civil rights movement or anti-war protests of the sixties. But there have been less dramatic, though no less passionate, rebellions led by young activists in previous centuries—rebellions that had lasting impact on the world around us. One such example is the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the art world in England was rattled by the initials PRB. The PRB (or Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) was founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. These three burgeoning artists (the oldest of whom was 21) and their disdain for the artistic conventions of the time would have a dramatic influence on the art world for generations to come.\n\nThe PRB was formed in response to the brotherhood’s belief that the current popular art being produced in England was lacking in meaning and aesthetic honesty. During the era leading up to the PRB, the Royal Academy dominated British art. The Royal Academy advocated a style that was typically staid and relied heavily upon the use of dark amber and brown tones to depict overly idealized landscapes, carefully arranged family portraits and still lifes, and overly dramatic nature scenes such as a boat caught in stormy seas. By contrast, the PRB believed that art should present subjects that, by their very nature, had greater meaning and more accurately depicted reality. The PRB was committed to bringing greater integrity to art and even went so far as to publish The Germ, a journal that extolled the virtues of the PRB’s aesthetic principles.\n\nTo develop subjects with greater meaning, the PRB initially turned to ancient myths and stories from the Bible. Many of the PRB’s biblically themed paintings portrayed the religious figures as regular people. This departure from the convention of the time is notable in John Everett Millais’ Christ in the Home of his Parents. In this painting, Jesus is portrayed as a young boy in his father’s carpentry shop. Everyone in the painting, including Christ himself, looks like a common person of that time period, complete with dirty feet and hands. This realism—especially as it related to the Biblical figures—was not well received by many in the art world at the time. Later works done by fellow PRB members, and those inspired by them, utilized themes from poetry, literature, and medieval tales, often with the aim of highlighting the societal and moral challenges of the time.\n\nWith the goal of bringing greater honesty to their work, the PRB ignored the convention of painting an imagined or remembered landscape or background. Instead, PRB members would hunt (sometimes for weeks) for locations to incorporate into their paintings and then paint them in exacting detail.\n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of PRB works—both in contrast to the works produced during the early nineteenth century and with the art of today—is their dramatic use of color. By committing themselves to the accurate depiction of nature, the PRB brought a freshness and drama to its work through the copious use of color. Further enhancing their work was a technique they used which involved applying the colored paint on top of wet white paint previously applied to their canvasses. The effect was to make the colors even brighter and more dramatic. Even today, more than 150 years later, PRB paintings have a luminescence beyond those of other works from the same time period. It is believed that their paintings have this quality today because the white layer underneath the colored paint continues to add brightness and life to the painting.\n\nOriginally founded by three upstart young men, the PRB had a tremendous influence on an entire generation of artists. William Morris, Ford Maddox Brown, and Edward Burne-Jones are just a few of the significant artists of the time whose work was dramatically influenced by the PRB.",

    passage: "In the following passage the author tells of public art and its functions.\n\nIn Manhattan’s Eighth Avenue/Fourteenth Street subway station, a grinning bronze alligator with human hands pops out of a manhole cover to grab a bronze “baby” whose head is the shape of a moneybag. In the Bronx General Post Office, a giant 13-panel painting called Resources of America celebrates the hard work and industrialism of America in the first half of the twentieth century. And in Brooklyn’s MetroTech Center just over the Brooklyn Bridge, several installations of art are on view at any given time—from an iron lasso resembling a giant charm bracelet to a series of wagons that play recordings of great American poems to a life-sized seeing eye dog that looks so real people are constantly stopping to pet it.\n\nThere exists in every city a symbiotic relationship between the city and its art. When we hear the term art, we tend to think of private art—the kind displayed in private spaces such as museums, concert halls, and galleries. But there is a growing interest in, and respect for, public art: the kind of art created for and displayed in public spaces such as parks, building lobbies, and sidewalks.\n\nAlthough all art is inherently public—created in order to convey an idea or emotion to others—“public art,” as opposed to art that is sequestered in museums and galleries, is art specifically designed for a public arena where the art will be encountered by people in their normal day-to-day activities. Public art can be purely ornamental or highly functional; it can be as subtle as a decorative door knob or as conspicuous as the Chicago Picasso. It is also an essential element of effective urban design.\n\nThe more obvious forms of public art include monuments, sculptures, fountains, murals, and gardens. But public art also takes the form of ornamental benches or street lights, decorative manhole covers, and mosaics on trash bins. Many city dwellers would be surprised to discover just how much public art is really around them and how much art they have passed by without noticing, and how much impact public art has on their day-to-day lives.\n\nPublic art fulfills several functions essential to the health of a city and its citizens. It educates about history and culture—of the artist, the neighborhood, the city, the nation. Public art is also a “place-making device” that instantly creates memorable, experiential landmarks, fashioning a unique identity for a public place, personalizing it and giving it a specific character. It stimulates the public, challenging viewers to interpret the art and arousing their emotions, and it promotes community by stimulating interaction among viewers. In serving these multiple and important functions, public art beautifies the area and regenerates both the place and the viewer.\n\nOne question often debated in public art forums is whether public art should be created with or by the public rather than for the public. Increasingly, cities and artists are recognizing the importance of creating works with meaning for the intended audience, and this generally requires direct input from the community or from an artist entrenched in that community. At the same time, however, art created for the community by an “outsider” often adds fresh perspective. Thus, cities and their citizens are best served by a combination of public art created by members of the community, art created with input from members of the community, and art created by others for the community.",

    passage: "The following passage is an excerpt from the National Institutes of Health that describes the effects and potential consequences of sleep deprivation.\n\nExperts say that if you feel drowsy during the day, even during boring activities, you haven’t had enough sleep. If you routinely fall asleep within five minutes of lying down, you probably have severe sleep deprivation, possibly even a sleep disorder. Microsleeps, or very brief episodes of sleep in an otherwise awake person, are another mark of sleep deprivation. In many cases, people are not aware that they are experiencing microsleeps. The widespread practice of “burning the candle at both ends” in Western industrialized societies has created so much sleep deprivation that what is really abnormal sleepiness is now almost the norm.\n\nMany studies make it clear that sleep deprivation is dangerous. Sleep-deprived people who are tested by using a driving simulator or by performing a hand-eye coordination task perform as badly as or worse than those who are intoxicated. Sleep deprivation also magnifies alcohol’s effects on the body, so a fatigued person who drinks will become much more impaired than someone who is well rested. Driver fatigue is responsible for an estimated 100,000 motor vehicle accidents and 1,500 deaths each year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Since drowsiness is the brain’s last step before falling asleep, driving while drowsy can—and often does—lead to disaster. Caffeine and other stimulants cannot overcome the effects of severe sleep deprivation. The National Sleep Foundation says that if you have trouble keeping your eyes focused, if you can’t stop yawning, or if you can’t remember driving the last few miles, you are probably too drowsy to drive safely.",

    id: "passage-27-leeuwenhoek",
    passage: "In the following passage, the author gives an account of the scientific discoveries made by Antoni van Leeuwenhoek in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe history of microbiology begins with a Dutch haberdasher named Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, a man of no formal scientific education. In the late 1600s, Leeuwenhoek, inspired by the magnifying lenses used by drapers to examine cloth, assembled some of the first microscopes. He developed a technique for grinding and polishing tiny, convex lenses, some of which could magnify an object up to 270 times. After scraping some plaque from between his teeth and examining it under a lens, Leeuwenhoek found tiny squirming creatures, which he called “animalcules.” His observations, which he reported to the Royal Society of London, are among the first descriptions of living bacteria. Leeuwenhoek discovered an entire universe invisible to the naked eye. He found more animalcules—protozoa and bacteria—in samples of pond water, rain water, and human saliva. He gave the first description of red corpuscles, observed plant tissue, examined muscle, and investigated the life cycle of insects.\n\nNearly two hundred years later, Leeuwenhoek’s discovery of microbes aided French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur to develop his “germ theory of disease.” This concept suggested that disease derives from tiny organisms attacking and weakening the body. The germ theory later helped doctors to fight infectious diseases including anthrax, diphtheria, polio, smallpox, tetanus, and typhoid. Leeuwenhoek did not foresee this legacy. In a 1716 letter, he described his contribution to science this way: “My work, which I’ve done for a long time, was not pursued in order to gain the praise I now enjoy, but chiefly from a craving after knowledge, which I notice resides in me more than in most other men. And therewithal, whenever I found out anything remarkable, I have thought it my duty to put down my discovery on paper, so that all ingenious people might be informed thereof.”",

    passage: "The following passage discusses the findings of several recent health surveys investigating the physical activity level of American adolescents.\n\nAlmost 50% of American teens are not vigorously active on a regular basis, contributing to a trend of sluggishness among Americans of all ages, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Adolescent female students are particularly inactive—29% are inactive compared with 15% of male students. Unfortunately, the sedentary habits of young “couch potatoes” often continue into adulthood. According to the Surgeon General’s 1996 Report on Physical Activity and Health, Americans become increasingly less active with each year of age. Inactivity can be a serious health risk factor, setting the stage for obesity and associated chronic illnesses like heart disease or diabetes. The benefits of exercise include building bone, muscle, and joints, controlling weight, and preventing the development of high blood pressure.\n\nSome studies suggest that physical activity may have other benefits as well. One CDC study found that high school students who take part in team sports or are physically active outside of school are less likely to engage in risky behaviors, like using drugs or smoking. Physical activity does not need to be strenuous to be beneficial. The CDC recommends moderate, daily physical activity for people of all ages, such as brisk walking for 30 minutes or 15–20 minutes of more intense exercise. A survey conducted by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education questioned teens about their attitudes toward exercise and about what it would take to get them moving. Teens chose friends (56%) as their most likely motivators for becoming more active, followed by parents (18%) and professional athletes (11%).",

    passage: "The following passage discusses the inspiration and career of the first woman to receive a M.D. degree from an American medical school in the nineteenth century.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell was the first woman to receive an M.D. degree since the Renaissance, graduating from Geneva Medical College, in New York state, in 1849. She supported women’s medical education and helped many other women’s careers. By establishing the New York Infirmary in 1857, she offered a practical solution to one of the problems facing women who were rejected from internships elsewhere but determined to expand their skills as physicians. She also published several important books on the issue of women in medicine, including Address on the Medical Education of Women in 1864 and Medicine as a Profession for Women in 1860.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell was born in Bristol, England in 1821, to Hannah Lane and Samuel Blackwell. Both for financial reasons and because her father wanted to help abolish slavery, the family moved to America when Elizabeth was eleven years old. Her father died in 1838. As adults, his children campaigned for women’s rights and supported the anti-slavery movement. In her book Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women, published in 1895, Dr. Blackwell wrote that she was initially repelled by the idea of studying medicine. She said she had “hated everything connected with the body, and could not bear the sight of a medical book . . . My favorite studies were history and metaphysics, and the very thought of dwelling on the physical structure of the body and its various ailments filled me with disgust.” Instead she went into teaching, then considered more suitable for a woman. She claimed that she turned to medicine after a close friend who was dying suggested she would have been spared her worst suffering if her physician had been a woman.\n\nBlackwell had no idea how to become a physician, so she consulted with several physicians known by her family. They told her it was a fine idea, but impossible; it was too expensive, and such education was not available to women. Yet Blackwell reasoned that if the idea were a good one, there must be some way to do it, and she was attracted by the challenge. She convinced two physician friends to let her read medicine with them for a year, and applied to all the medical schools in New York and Philadelphia. She also applied to twelve more schools in the northeast states and was accepted by Geneva Medical College in 1847. The faculty, assuming that the all-male student body would never agree to a woman joining their ranks, allowed them to vote on her admission. As a joke, they voted “yes,” and she gained admittance, despite the reluctance of most students and faculty.\n\nTwo years later, in 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to receive an M.D. degree from an American medical school. She worked in clinics in London and Paris for two years, and studied midwifery at La Maternité where she contracted “purulent opthalmia” from a young patient. When Blackwell lost sight in one eye, she returned to New York City in 1851, giving up her dream of becoming a surgeon.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell established a practice in New York City, but had few patients and few opportunities for intellectual exchange with other physicians and “the means of increasing medical knowledge which dispensary practice affords.” She applied for a job as physician at the women’s department of a large city dispensary, but was refused. In 1853, with the help of friends, she opened her own dispensary in a single rented room, seeing patients three afternoons a week. The dispensary was incorporated in 1854 and moved to a small house she bought on 15th Street. Her sister, Dr. Emily Blackwell, joined her in 1856 and, together with Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, they opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children at 64 Bleecker Street in 1857. This institution and its medical college for women (opened 1867) provided training and experience for women doctors and medical care for the poor.\n\nAs her health declined, Blackwell gave up the practice of medicine in the late 1870s, though she still campaigned for reform.",

    id: "passage-30-aging",
    passage: "The following passage offers the author’s perspective on the need for healthcare providers with specialized training to care for a rapidly expanding population of older Americans.\n\nThe U.S. population is going gray. A rising demographic tide of aging baby boomers—those born between 1946 and 1964—and increased longevity have made adults age 65 and older the fastest growing segment of today’s population. In thirty years, this segment of the population will be nearly twice as large as it is today. By then, an estimated 70 million people will be over age 65. The number of “oldest old”—those age 85 and older—is 34 times greater than in 1900 and likely to expand five-fold by 2050.\n\nThis unprecedented “elder boom” will have a profound effect on American society, particularly the field of healthcare. Is the U.S. health system equipped to deal with the demands of an aging population? Although we have adequate physicians and nurses, many of them are not trained to handle the multiple needs of older patients. Today we have about 9,000 geriatricians (physicians who are experts in aging related issues). Some studies estimate a need for 36,000 geriatricians by 2030.\n\nMany doctors today treat a patient of 75 the same way they would treat a 40–year-old patient. However, although seniors are healthier than ever, physical challenges often increase with age. By age 75, adults often have two to three medical conditions. Diagnosing multiple health problems and knowing how they interact is crucial for effectively treating older patients. Healthcare professionals—often pressed for time in hectic daily practices—must be diligent about asking questions and collecting “evidence” from their elderly patients. Finding out about a patient’s over-the-counter medications or living conditions could reveal an underlying problem.\n\nLack of training in geriatric issues can result in healthcare providers overlooking illnesses or conditions that may lead to illness. Inadequate nutrition is a common, but often unrecognized, problem among frail seniors. An elderly patient who has difficulty preparing meals at home may become vulnerable to malnutrition or another medical condition. Healthcare providers with training in aging issues may be able to address this problem without the costly solution of admitting a patient to a nursing home.\n\nDepression, a treatable condition that affects nearly five million seniors, also goes undetected by some healthcare providers. Some healthcare professionals view depression as “just part of getting old.” Untreated, this illness can have serious, even fatal consequences. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, older Americans account for a disproportionate share of suicide deaths, making up 18% of suicide deaths in 2000. Healthcare providers could play a vital role in preventing this outcome—several studies have shown that up to 75% of seniors who die by suicide visited a primary care physician within a month of their death.\n\nHealthcare providers face additional challenges to providing high-quality care to the aging population. Because the numbers of ethnic minority elders are growing faster than the aging population as a whole, providers must train to care for a more racially and ethnically diverse population of elderly. Respect and understanding of diverse cultural beliefs is necessary to provide the most effective healthcare to all patients. Providers must also be able to communicate complicated medical conditions or treatments to older patients who may have a visual, hearing, or cognitive impairment.\n\nAs older adults make up an increasing proportion of the healthcare caseload, the demand for aging specialists must expand as well. Healthcare providers who work with the elderly must understand and address not only the physical but mental, emotional, and social changes of the aging process. They need to be able to distinguish between “normal” characteristics associated with aging and illness. Most crucially, they should look beyond symptoms and consider ways that will help a senior maintain and improve her quality of life.",

    id: "passage-31-smoking",
    passage: "The following passage is an excerpt from a recent introduction to the momentous 1964 Report on Smoking and Health issued by the United States Surgeon General. It discusses the inspiration behind the report and the report’s effect on public attitudes toward smoking.\n\nNo single issue has preoccupied the Surgeons General of the past four decades more than smoking. The reports of the Surgeon General have alerted the nation to the health risk of smoking, and have transformed the issue from one of individual and consumer choice, to one of epidemiology, public health, and risk for smokers and non-smokers alike. Debate over the hazards and benefits of smoking has divided physicians, scientists, governments, smokers, and non-smokers since Tobacco nicotiana was first imported to Europe from its native soil in the Americas in the sixteenth century. A dramatic increase in cigarette smoking in the United States in the twentieth century called forth anti-smoking movements. Reformers, hygienists, and public health officials argued that smoking brought about general malaise, physiological malfunction, and a decline in mental and physical efficiency. Evidence of the ill effects of smoking accumulated during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.\n\nEpidemiologists used statistics and large-scale, long-term, case control surveys to link the increase in lung cancer mortality to smoking. Pathologists and laboratory scientists confirmed the statistical relationship of smoking to lung cancer as well as to other serious diseases, such as bronchitis, emphysema, and coronary heart disease. Smoking, these studies suggested, and not air pollution, asbestos contamination, or radioactive materials, was the chief cause of the epidemic rise of lung cancer in the twentieth century. On June 12, 1957, Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney declared it the official position of the U.S. Public Health Service that the evidence pointed to a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer.\n\nThe impulse for an official report on smoking and health, however, came from an alliance of prominent private health organizations. In June 1961, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the National Tuberculosis Association, and the American Public Health Association addressed a letter to President John F. Kennedy, in which they called for a national commission on smoking, dedicated to “seeking a solution to this health problem that would interfere least with the freedom of industry or the happiness of individuals.” The Kennedy administration responded the following year, after prompting from a widely circulated critical study on cigarette smoking by the Royal College of Physicians of London. On June 7, 1962, recently appointed Surgeon General Luther L. Terry announced that he would convene a committee of experts to conduct a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on the smoking question. . . .\n\nMeeting at the National Library of Medicine on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, from November 1962 through January 1964, the committee reviewed more than 7,000 scientific articles with the help of over 150 consultants. Terry issued the commission’s report on January 11, 1964, choosing a Saturday to minimize the effect on the stock market and to maximize coverage in the Sunday papers. As Terry remembered the event, two decades later, the report “hit the country like a bombshell. It was front page news and a lead story on every radio and television station in the United States and many abroad.”\n\nThe report highlighted the deleterious health consequences of tobacco use. Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General held cigarette smoking responsible for a 70% increase in the mortality rate of smokers over non-smokers. The report estimated that average smokers had a nine- to ten-fold risk of developing lung cancer compared to non-smokers: heavy smokers had at least a twenty-fold risk. The risk rose with the duration of smoking and diminished with the cessation of smoking. The report also named smoking as the most important cause of chronic bronchitis and pointed to a correlation between smoking and emphysema, and smoking and coronary heart disease. It noted that smoking during pregnancy reduced the average weight of newborns. On one issue the committee hedged: nicotine addiction. It insisted that the “tobacco habit should be characterized as an habituation rather than an addiction,” in part because the addictive properties of nicotine were not yet fully understood, in part because of differences over the meaning of addiction.\n\nThe 1964 report on smoking and health had an impact on public attitudes and policy. A Gallup Survey conducted in 1958 found that only 44% of Americans believed smoking caused cancer, while 78% believed so by 1968. In the course of a decade, it had become common knowledge that smoking damaged health, and mounting evidence of health risks gave Terry’s 1964 report public resonance. Yet, while the report proclaimed that “cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action,” it remained silent on concrete remedies. That challenge fell to politicians. In 1965, Congress required all cigarette packages distributed in the United States to carry a health warning, and since 1970 this warning is made in the name of the Surgeon General. In 1969, cigarette advertising on television and radio was banned, effective September 1970.",

    passage: "PASSAGE 1\nElective and cosmetic plastic surgery is one of the fastest growing segments of healthcare, second only to geriatric care. As the “baby boomers” (those born between 1945 and 1965) reach their half-century mark, more Americans are seeking cosmetic procedures that minimize the visible signs of aging. The demand for self-improvement has increased as the job market has become more competitive and a high divorce rate spurs the search for new personal relationships. Increased discretionary wealth and a wider acceptance of cosmetic techniques have also contributed to the spike in cosmetic surgery.\nIn the 1980s, I was just beginning as an internist, working in a private practice. Then in my late twenties, I felt pity for my patients who talked to me about a surgical fix for their wrinkles or other signs of aging. I felt that if they had a developed sense of self-esteem, they would not feel the need to surgically alter their appearance. I also felt a certain degree of envy for my cosmetic-surgeon colleagues, some of whom worked across the hall. To my “green” eye, they looked like slick salespeople reaping large financial rewards from others’ insecurity and vanity. It was difficult for me to reconcile the fact that patients were willing to fork over thousands of dollars for cosmetic fixes, while primary care physicians struggled to keep their practices financially viable.\nSince that time, my attitude has changed. Although cosmetic surgery sometimes produces negative outcomes—the media often highlights surgery “disasters”—for the most part, the health risk for cosmetic procedures is low and patient satisfaction is high. Often, people who have been hobbled by poor body image all of their lives, walk away from cosmetic surgery with confidence and the motivation to lead healthier lives. In addition, reconstructive surgery for burn and accident victims or to those disfigured from disease restores selfesteem and wellbeing in a way that other therapies cannot. I believe it is time for members of the medical community to examine the benefits and results of cosmetic surgery without prejudice or jealousy.\n\nPASSAGE 2\nBeauty is only skin deep, or so goes the old adage. However, in a culture increasingly fixated on youthfulness and saturated with media images of “ideal”-looking men and women, cosmetic plastic surgery seems like the norm instead of the exception. Nearly 6.6 million Americans opted for cosmetic surgery in 2002, with women accounting for 85% of cosmetic-surgery patients, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Once the province of older women, cosmetic surgery is increasingly an option for 35– to 50–year-olds, who made up 45% of cosmetic-surgery patients in 2002.\nComing of age in the 1970s, I grew up believing in the spirit of feminism, a ready warrior for equal rights for women in the home and workplace. I believed that women should be valued for who they are and what they do, and not for how they look. But as I approach my mid-forties, I look in the mirror and wonder about the reflection I see. Although I adhere to a healthy lifestyle, eat well, exercise regularly, and feel energetic, the reality is that I am beginning to look, well, middle-aged.\nBecause I am a successful professional, I have the means to afford elective surgery. And like Pandora’s Box, once I opened the door to anti-aging surgical possibilities, it seems almost impossible to close it again. In 2002, more than 1.1 million Americans had Botox injections—a procedure that erases wrinkles by paralyzing facial muscles. I find myself asking: Why not me? Is it time to jump on the bandwagon? In a competitive culture where looks count, is it almost impractical not to?\nWhat stops me? Perhaps it is queasiness about the surgeon’s scalpel. Risks accompany any kind of surgery. Perhaps I find the idea of paralyzing my facial muscles somewhat repellent and a betrayal of the emotions I have experienced—the joys and loses of a lifetime—that are written in those “crow’s feet” and “worry lines.” Perhaps yet, it is my earlier feminist fervor and idealism—a remnant of my youth that I believe is worth preserving more than wrinkle-free skin.",

    passage: "Once people wore garlic around their necks to ward off disease. Today, most Americans would scoff at the idea of wearing a necklace of garlic cloves to enhance their wellbeing. However, you might find a number of Americans willing to ingest capsules of pulverized garlic or other herbal supplements in the name of health.\n\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which includes a range of practices outside of conventional medicine such as herbs, homeopathy, massage, yoga, and acupuncture, holds increasing appeal for Americans. In fact, according to one estimate, 42% of Americans have used alternative therapies. A Harvard Medical School survey found that young adults (those born between 1965 and 1979) are the most likely to use alternative treatments, whereas people born before 1945 are the least likely to use these therapies. Nonetheless, in all age groups, the use of unconventional healthcare practices has steadily increased since the 1950s, and the trend is likely to continue.\n\nCAM has become a big business as Americans dip into their wallets to pay for alternative treatments. A 1997 American Medical Association study estimated that the public spent $21.2 billion for alternative medicine therapies in that year, more than half of which were “out-of-pocket” expenditures, meaning they were not covered by health insurance. Indeed, Americans made more out-of-pocket expenditures for alternative services than they did for out-of-pocket payments for hospital stays in 1997. In addition, the number of total visits to alternative medicine providers (about 629 million) exceeded the tally of visits to primary care physicians (386 million) in that year.\n\nHowever, the public has not abandoned conventional medicine for alternative healthcare. Most Americans seek out alternative therapies as a complement to their conventional healthcare whereas only a small percentage of Americans rely primarily on alternative care. Why have so many patients turned to alternative therapies? Frustrated by the time constraints of managed care and alienated by conventional medicine’s focus on technology, some feel that a holistic approach to healthcare better reflects their beliefs and values. Others seek therapies that will relieve symptoms associated with chronic disease, symptoms that mainstream medicine cannot treat.\n\nSome alternative therapies have crossed the line into mainstream medicine as scientific investigation has confirmed their safety and efficacy. For example, today physicians may prescribe acupuncture for pain management or to control the nausea associated with chemotherapy. Most U.S. medical schools teach courses in alternative therapies and many health insurance companies offer some alternative medicine benefits. Yet, despite their gaining acceptance, the majority of alternative therapies have not been researched in controlled studies. New research efforts aim at testing alternative methods and providing the public with information about which are safe and effective and which are a waste of money, or possibly dangerous.\n\nSo what about those who swear by the health benefits of the “smelly rose,” garlic? Observational studies that track disease incidence in different populations suggest that garlic use in the diet may act as a cancer-fighting agent, particularly for prostate and stomach cancer. However, these findings have not been confirmed in clinical studies. And yes, reported side effects include garlic odor.",

    passage: "In the following article, the author speculates about a connection between the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet recommended by the medical establishment in the last twenty years and the increasing rate of obesity among Americans.\n\nAmerican dietitians and members of the medical community have ridiculed low-carbohydrate diets as quackery for the past thirty years, while extolling a diet that cuts down on fat, limits meat consumption, and relies on carbohydrates as its staple. Many Americans are familiar with the food pyramid promoted by the U.S. government, with its foundation of carbohydrates such as breads, rice, and pasta, and its apex allotted to fats, oils, and sweets. Adhering to the government’s anti-fat, pro-carbohydrate gospel, food manufacturers have pumped out fat-free grain products that lure consumers with the promise of leaner days. Then, why are Americans getting so fat? Could the dietary recommendations of the last twenty years be wrong? And what’s more, could the proponents of diets that push protein and fat be right?\n\nFact: Obesity rates have soared throughout the country since the 1980s. The United States Centers of Disease Control reports that the number of obese adults has doubled in the last twenty years. The number of obese children and teenagers has almost tripled, increasing 120% among African-American and Latino children and 50% among white children. The risk for Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity, has increased dramatically as well. Disturbingly, the disease now affects 25% to 30% of children, compared with 3% to 5% two decades ago.\n\nWhat is behind this trend? Supersized portions, cheap fast food, and soft drinks combined with a sedentary lifestyle of TV watching or Internet surfing have most likely contributed to the rapid rise of obesity. Yet, there might be more to it: is it a coincidence that obesity rates increased in the last twenty years—the same time period in which the low-fat dietary doctrine has reigned? Before the 1980s, the conventional wisdom was that fat and protein created a feeling of satiation, so that overeating would be less likely. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, were regarded as a recipe for stoutness. This perception began to change after World War II when coronary heart disease reached near epidemic proportions among middle-aged men. A theory that dietary fat might increase cholesterol levels and, in turn, increase the risk of heart disease emerged in the 1950s and gained increasing acceptance by the late 1970s. In 1979, the focus of the food guidelines promoted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began to shift away from getting enough nutrients to avoiding excess fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium—the components believed to be linked to heart disease. The anti-fat credo was born.\n\nTo date, the studies that have tried to link dietary fat to increased risk of coronary heart disease have remained ambiguous. Studies have shown that cholesterol-lowering drugs help reduce the risk of heart disease, but whether a diet low in cholesterol can do the same is still questionable. While nutrition experts are debating whether a low-fat, carbohydrate-based diet is the healthiest diet for Americans, nearly all agree that the anti-fat message of the last twenty years has been oversimplified. For example, some fats and oils like those found in olive oil and nuts are beneficial to the heart and may deserve a larger proportion in the American diet than their place at the tip of the food pyramid indicates. Likewise, some carbohydrates that form the basis of the food pyramid, like the “refined” carbohydrates contained in white bread, pasta, and white rice, are metabolized in the body much the same way sweets are. According to one Harvard Medical School researcher, a breakfast of a bagel with low-fat cream cheese is “metabolically indistinguishable from a bowl of sugar.”\n\nSo what about those high-fat, protein diets that restrict carbohydrates like the popular Atkins’ diet and others? A small group of nutrition experts within the medical establishment find it hard to ignore the anecdotal evidence that many lose weight successfully on these diets. They are arguing that those diets should not be dismissed out of hand, but researched and tested more closely. Still others fear that Americans, hungry to find a weight-loss regimen, may embrace a diet that has no long-term data about whether it works or is safe. What is clear is that Americans are awaiting answers and in the meantime, we need to eat something.",

When she told Cholly, he surprised her by being pleased. [ . . . ] They eased back into a relationship more like the early days of their marriage, when he asked if she were tired or wanted him to bring her something from the store. In this state of ease, Pauline stopped doing day work and returned to her own housekeeping. But the loneliness in those two rooms had not gone away. When the winter sun hit the peeling green paint of the kitchen chairs, when the smoked hocks were boiling in the pot, when all she could hear was the truck delivering furniture downstairs, she thought about back home, about how she had been all alone most of the time then too, but this lonesomeness was different. Then she stopped staring at the green chairs, at the delivery truck; she went to the movies instead. There in the dark her memory was refreshed, and she succumbed to her earlier dreams. Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought.

    passage: "In this excerpt from Sherman Alexie’s novel Reservation Blues, Thomas struggles with his feelings about his father, Samuel.\n\nThomas, Chess, and Checkers stayed quiet for a long time.

That mourning song was B-7 on every reservation jukebox.\n\nAfter the song, Thomas stood and walked away from the table where his father lay flat as a paper plate. He walked outside and cried. Not because he needed to be alone; not because he was afraid to cry in front of women. He just wanted his tears to be individual, not tribal. Those tribal tears collected and fermented in huge BIA [Bureau of Indian Affairs] barrels. Then the BIA poured those tears into beer and Pepsi cans and distributed them back onto the reservation. Thomas wanted his tears to be selfish and fresh.\n\n“Hello,” he said to the night sky. He wanted to say the first word of a prayer or a joke. A prayer or a joke often sound alike on the reservation.\n\n“Help,” he said to the ground. He knew the words to a million songs: Indian, European, African, Mexican, Asian. He sang “Stairway to Heaven” in four different languages but never knew where that staircase stood. He sang the same Indian songs continually but never sang them correctly.

    passage: "In this excerpt from John Steinbeck’s 1936 novel In Dubious Battle, Mac and Doc Burton discuss “the cause” that leads hundreds of migratory farm workers to unite and strike against landowners.\n\nMac spoke softly, for the night seemed to be listening. “You’re a mystery to me, too, Doc.”\n“Me? A mystery?”\n“Yes, you. You’re not a Party man, but you work with us all the time; you never get anything for it. I don’t know whether you believe in what we’re doing or not, you never say, you just work. I’ve been out with you before, and I’m not sure you believe in the cause at all.”\nDr. Burton laughed softly. “It would be hard to say. I could tell you some of the things I think; you might not like them. I’m pretty sure you won’t like them.”\n“Well, let’s hear them anyway.”\n“Well, you say I don’t believe in the cause. That’s not like not believing in the moon. There’ve been communes before, and there will be again. But you people have an idea that if you can establish the thing, the job’ll be done. Nothing stops, Mac. If you were able to put an idea into effect tomorrow, it would start changing right away. Establish a commune, and the same gradual flux will continue.”\n“Then you don’t think the cause is good?”\nBurton sighed. “You see? We’re going to pile up on that old rock again. That’s why I don’t like to talk very often. Listen to me, Mac. My senses aren’t above reproach, but they’re all I have. I want to see the whole picture—as nearly as I can. I don’t want to put on the blinders of ‘good’ and ‘bad,’ and limit my vision. If I used the term ‘good’ on a thing I’d lose my license to inspect it, because there might be bad in it. Don’t you see? I want to be able to look at the whole thing.”\nMac broke in heatedly, “How about social injustice? The profit system? You have to say they’re bad.”\nDr. Burton threw back his head and looked at the sky. “Mac,” he said. “Look at the physiological injustice, the injustice of tetanus [ . . . ], the gangster methods of amoebic dysentery—that’s my field.”\n“Revolution and communism will cure social injustice.”\n“Yes, and disinfection and prophylaxis will prevent others.”\n“It’s different, though; men are doing one, and germs are doing the other.”\n“I can’t see much difference, Mac.”\n[ . . . ] “Why do you hang around with us if you aren’t for us?”\n“I want to see,” Burton said. “When you cut your finger, and streptococci get in the wound, there’s a swelling and a soreness. That swelling is the fight your body puts up, the pain is the battle. You can’t tell which one is going to win, but the wound is the first battleground. If the cells lose the first fight the streptococci invade, and the fight goes on up the arm. Mac, these little strikes are like the infection. Something has got into the men; a little fever has started and the lymphatic glands are shooting in the reinforcements. I want to see, so I go to the seat of the wound.”\n“You figure the strike is a wound?”\n“Yes. Group-men are always getting some kind of infection. This seems to be a bad one. I want to see, Mac. I want to watch these group-men, for they seem to me to be a new individual, not at all like single men. A man in a group isn’t himself at all, he’s a cell in an organism that isn’t like him any more than the cells in your body are like you. I want to watch the group, and see what it’s like. People have said, ‘mobs are crazy, you can’t tell what they’ll do.’ Why don’t people look at mobs not as men, but as mobs? A mob nearly always seems to act reasonably, for a mob.”\n“Well, what’s this got to do with the cause?”\n“It might be like this, Mac: When group-man wants to move, he makes a standard. ‘God wills that we recapture the Holy Land’; or he says, ‘We fight to make the world safe for democracy’; or he says, ‘We will wipe out social injustice with communism.’ But the group doesn’t care about the Holy Land, or Democracy, or Communism. Maybe the group simply wants to move, to fight, and uses these words simply to reassure the brains of individual men. I say it might be like that, Mac.”\n“Not with the cause, it isn’t,” Mac cried.",

    passage: "In this passage, written in 1925, writer Edith Wharton distinguishes between subjects suitable for short stories and those suitable for novels.\n\nIt is sometimes said that a “good subject” for a short story should always be capable of being expanded into a novel.\n\nThe principle may be defendable in special cases; but it is certainly a misleading one on which to build any general theory. Every “subject” (in the novelist’s sense of the term) must necessarily contain within itself its own dimensions; and one of the fiction-writer’s essential gifts is that of discerning whether the subject which presents itself to him, asking for incarnation, is suited to the proportions of a short story or of a novel. If it appears to be adapted to both the chances are that it is inadequate to either.\n\nIt would be a great mistake, however, to try to base a hard-and-fast theory on the denial of the rule as on its assertion. Instances of short stories made out of subjects that could have been expanded into a novel, and that are yet typical short stories and not mere stunted novels, will occur to everyone. General rules in art are useful chiefly as a lamp in a mine, or a handrail down a black stairway; they are necessary for the sake of the guidance they give, but it is a mistake, once they are formulated, to be too much in awe of them.\n\nThere are at least two reasons why a subject should find expression in novel-form rather than as a tale; but neither is based on the number of what may be conveniently called incidents, or external happenings, which the narrative contains. There are novels of action which might be condensed into short stories without the loss of their distinguishing qualities. The marks of the subject requiring a longer development are, first, the gradual unfolding of the inner life of its characters, and secondly the need of producing in the reader’s mind the sense of the lapse of time. Outward events of the most varied and exciting nature may without loss of probability be crowded into a few hours, but moral dramas usually have their roots deep in the soul, their rise far back in time; and the suddenest-seeming clash in which they culminate should be led up to step by step if it is to explain and justify itself.\n\nThere are cases, indeed, when the short story may make use of the moral drama at its culmination. If the incident dealt with be one which a single retrospective flash sufficiently lights up, it is qualified for use as a short story; but if the subject be so complex, and its successive phases so interesting, as to justify elaboration, the lapse of time must necessarily be suggested, and the novel-form becomes appropriate.\n\nThe effect of compactness and instantaneity sought in the short story is attained mainly by the observance of two “unities”—the old traditional one of time, and that other, more modern and complex, which requires that any rapidly enacted episode shall be seen through only one pair of eyes . . . .\n\nOne thing more is needful for the ultimate effect of probability; and that is, never let the character who serves as reflector record anything not naturally within his register. It should be the storyteller’s first care to choose this reflecting mind deliberately, as one would choose a building-site, or decide upon the orientation of one’s house, and when this is done, to live inside the mind chosen, trying to feel, see and react exactly as the latter would, no more, no less, and, above all, no otherwise. Only thus can the writer avoid attributing incongruities of thought and metaphor to his chosen interpreter.",

If you can’t stand the coldness of my sort of life, and the strain of it, go back to the gutter. Work ’til you are more a brute than a human being; and then cuddle and squabble and drink ’til you fall asleep. Oh, it’s a fine life, the life of the gutter. It’s real: it’s warm: it’s violent: you can feel it through the thickest skin: you can taste it and smell it without any training or any work. Not like Science and Literature and Classical Music and Philosophy and Art. You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don’t you? Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like. Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with. If you can’t appreciate what you’ve got, you’d better get what you can appreciate.\n\nLIZA (desperate): Oh, you are a cruel tyrant. I can’t talk to you: you turn everything against me: I’m always in the wrong. But you know very well all the time that you’re nothing but a bully. You know I can’t go back to the gutter, as you call it, and that I have no real friends in the world but you and the Colonel. You know well I couldn’t bear to live with a low common man after you two; and it’s wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could. You think I must go back to Wimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but father’s. But don’t you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down. I’ll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he’s able to support me.\n\nHIGGINS (sitting down beside her): Rubbish! You shall marry an ambassador. You shall marry the Governor-General of India or the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, or somebody who wants a deputy queen. I’m not going to have my masterpiece thrown away on Freddy.\n\nLIZA: You think I like you to say that. But I haven’t forgot what you said a minute ago; and I won’t be coaxed round as if I was a baby or a puppy. If I can’t have kindness, I’ll have independence.\n\nHIGGINS: Independence? That’s middle class blasphemy. We are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth.\n\nLIZA (rising determinedly): I’ll let you see whether I’m dependent on you. If you can preach, I can teach. I’ll go and be a teacher.\n\nHIGGINS: What’ll you teach, in heaven’s name?\n\nLIZA: What you taught me. I’ll teach phonetics.\n\nHIGGINS: Ha! ha! ha!\n\nLIZA: I’ll offer myself as an assistant to Professor Nepean.\n\nHIGGINS (rising in a fury): What! That impostor! that humbug! that toadying ignoramus! Teach him my methods! my discoveries! You take one step in his direction and I’ll wring your neck. (He lays hands on her.) Do you hear?\n\nLIZA (defiantly resistant): Wring away. What do I care? I knew you’d strike me some day. (He lets her go, stamping with rage at having forgotten himself, and recoils so hastily that he stumbles back into his seat on the ottoman.) Aha! Now I know how to deal with you. What a fool I was not to think of it before! You can’t take away the knowledge you gave me. You said I had a finer ear than you. And I can be civil and kind to people, which is more than you can. Aha! That’s done you, Henry Higgins, it has. Now I don’t care that (snapping her fingers) for your bullying and your big talk. I’ll advertise it in the papers that your duchess is only a flower girl that you taught, and that she’ll teach anybody to be a duchess just the same in six months for a thousand guineas. Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to be as good as you, I could just kick myself.",

    passage: "In this excerpt from Charlotte Bronte’s novel Jane Eyre, the narrator decides to leave Lowood, the boarding school where she has lived for eight years.\n\nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary; to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace: she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.\n\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better-regulated feelings had become inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.\n\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her traveling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honor of the occasion.\n\nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone; it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquility was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\n\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks: it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two: how I longed to follow it further! I recalled the time when I had traveled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight: an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies: such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough: I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”",

PETERS: Well, I must get these things wrapped up. They may be through sooner than we think. [Putting apron and other things together.] I wonder where I can find a piece of paper, and string.\nMRS. HALE: In that cupboard, maybe.\nMRS. PETERS [looking in cupboard]: Why, here’s a birdcage. [Holds it up.] Did she have a bird, Mrs. Hale?\nMRS. HALE: Why, I don’t know whether she did or not—I’ve not been here for so long. There was a man around last year selling canaries cheap, but I don’t know as she took one; maybe she did. She used to sing real pretty herself.\nMRS. PETERS [glancing around]: Seems funny to think of a bird here. But she must have had one, or why would she have a cage? I wonder what happened to it.\nMRS. HALE: I s’pose maybe the cat got it.\nMRS. PETERS: No, she didn’t have a cat. She’s got that feeling some people have about cats—being afraid of them. My cat got in her room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out.\nMRS. HALE: My sister Bessie was like that. Queer, ain’t it?\nMRS. PETERS [examining the cage]: Why, look at this door. It’s broke. One hinge is pulled apart.\nMRS. HALE [looking too]: Looks as if someone must have been rough with it.\nMRS. PETERS: Why, yes.\n[She brings the cage forward and puts it on the table.]\nMRS. HALE: I wish if they’re going to find any evidence they’d be about it. I don’t like this place.\nMRS.

PETERS: But of course you were awful busy, Mrs. Hale—your house and your children.\nMRS. HALE: I could’ve come. I stayed away because it weren’t cheerful—and that’s why I ought to have come. I—I’ve never liked this place. Maybe because it’s down in a hollow and you don’t see the road. I dunno what it is but it’s a lonesome place and always was. I wish I had come over to see Minnie Foster sometimes. I can see now—\n[Shakes her head.]\nMRS. PETERS: Well, you mustn’t reproach yourself, Mrs. Hale. Somehow we just don’t see how it is with other folks until—something comes up.\nMRS. HALE: Not having children makes less work—but it makes a quiet house, and Wright out to work all day, and no company when he did come in. Did you know John Wright, Mrs. Peters?\nMRS. PETERS: Not to know him; I’ve seen him in town. They say he was a good man.\nMRS. HALE: Yes—good; he didn’t drink, and kept his word as well as most, I guess, and paid his debts. But he was a hard man, Mrs. Peters. Just to pass the time of day with him—[shivers]. Like a raw wind that gets to the bone. [Pauses, her eye falling on the cage.] I should think she would’a wanted a bird. But what do you suppose went with it?\nMRS. PETERS: I don’t know, unless it got sick and died.\n[She reaches over and swings the broken door, swings it again. Both women watch it.]\nMRS. HALE: You weren’t raised round here, were you? [MRS. PETERS shakes her head.] You didn’t know—her?\nMRS. PETERS: Not till they brought her yesterday.\nMRS. HALE: She—come to think of it, she was kind of like a bird herself—real sweet and pretty, but kind of timid and—fluttery. How—she—did—change. [Silence; then as if struck by a happy thought and relieved to get back to every day things.] Tell you what, Mrs. Peters, why don’t you take the quilt in with you? It might take up her mind.\nMRS. PETERS: Why, I think that’s a real nice idea, Mrs. Hale. There couldn’t possibly be any objection to it, could there? Now, just what would I take? I wonder if her patches are in here—and her things.\n[They look in the sewing basket.]\nMRS. HALE: Here’s some red. I expect this has got sewing things in it. [Brings out a fancy box.] What a pretty box. Looks like something somebody would give you. Maybe her scissors are in here. [Opens box. Suddenly puts her hand to her nose.] Why—[MRS. PETERS bends nearer, then turns her face away.] There’s something wrapped in this piece of silk.\nMRS. PETERS [lifting the silk]: Why this isn’t her scissors.\nMRS. HALE [lifting the silk]: Oh, Mrs. Peters—it’s—\n[MRS. PETERS bends closer.]\nMRS. PETERS: It’s the bird.\nMRS. HALE [jumping up]: But, Mrs. Peters—look at it! Its neck! Look at its neck! It’s all—to the other side.\nMRS. PETERS: Somebody—wrung—its—neck.\n[Their eyes meet. A look of growing comprehension, of horror. Steps are heard outside. MRS.

    passage: "In Passage 1, an excerpt from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein explains his motive for creating his creature. In Passage 2, an excerpt from H.G. Wells’ 1896 novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, Dr. Moreau explains to the narrator why he has been performing experiments on animals to transform them into humans.\n\nPASSAGE 1\nI see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibers, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of my human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination, and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labors, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic, impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.\n\nPASSAGE 2\n“Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into new shapes. To that—to the study of the plasticity of living forms—my life has been devoted. I have studied for years, gaining in knowledge as I go. I see you look horrified, and yet I am telling you nothing new. It all lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but no one had the temerity to touch it. It’s not simply the outward form of an animal I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm of the creature, may also be made to undergo an enduring modification, of which vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead matter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar to you.\n“A similar operation is the transfusion of blood, with which subject indeed I began. These are all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far more extensive, were the operations of those medieval practitioners who made dwarfs and beggar cripples and show-monsters; some vestiges of whose art still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them in L’Homme qui Rit. . . . But perhaps my meaning grows plain now. You begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue from one part of an animal to another, or from one animal to another, to alter its chemical reactions and methods of growth, to modify the articulations of its limbs, and indeed to change it in its most intimate structure?\n“And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought as an end, and systematically, by modern investigators, until I took it up! Some such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery; most of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been demonstrated, as it were, by accident—by tyrants, by criminals, by the breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of untrained clumsyhanded men working for their own immediate ends. I was the first man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth.\n“Yet one would imagine it must have been practiced in secret before. Such creatures as Siamese Twins . . . . And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No doubt their chief aim was artistic torture, but some, at least, of the inquisitors must have had a touch of scientific curiosity . . . .”\n“But,” said I. “These things—these animals talk!”\nHe said that was so, and proceeded to point out that the possibilities of vivisection do not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may be educated. The mental structure is even less determinate than the bodily. In our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of replacing old inherent instincts by new suggestions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas. [ . . . ]\nBut I asked him why he had taken the human form as a model. There seemed to me then, and there still seems to me now, a strange wickedness in that choice.\nHe confessed that he had chosen that form by chance.\n“I might just as well have worked to form sheep into llamas, and llamas into sheep. I suppose there is something in the human form that appeals to the artistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can. But I’ve not confined myself to man-making. Once or twice . . . .” He was silent, for a minute perhaps. “These years! How they have slipped by! And here I have wasted a day saving your life, and am now wasting an hour explaining myself!”\n“But,” said I, “I still do not understand. Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain? The only thing that could excuse vivisection to me would be some application—”\n“Precisely,” said he. “But you see I am differently constituted. We are on different platforms. You are a materialist.”\n“I am not a materialist,” I began hotly.\n“In my view—in my view. For it is just this question of pain that parts us. So long as visible or audible pain turns you sick, so long as your own pain drives you, so long as pain underlies your propositions about sin, so long, I tell you, you are an animal, thinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels. This pain—”\nI gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.\n“Oh! But it is such a little thing. A mind truly open to what science has to teach must see that it is a little thing.”",

    passage: "The following passage describes the transition from the swing era to bebop in the history of jazz music.\n\nJazz, from its early roots in slave spirituals and the marching bands of New Orleans, had developed into the predominant American musical style by the 1930s. In this era, jazz musicians played a lush, orchestrated style known as swing. Played in large ensembles, also called big bands, swing filled the dance halls and nightclubs. Jazz, once considered risqué, was made more accessible to the masses with the vibrant, swinging sounds of these big bands. Then came bebop. In the mid-1940s, jazz musicians strayed from the swing style and developed a more improvisational method of playing known as bebop. Jazz was transformed from popular music to an elite art form.\n\nThe soloists in the big bands improvised from the melody. The young musicians who ushered in bebop, notably trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker, expanded on the improvisational elements of the big bands. They played with advanced harmonies, changed chord structures, and made chord substitutions. These young musicians got their starts with the leading big bands of the day, but during World War II—as older musicians were drafted and dance halls made cutbacks—they started to play together in smaller groups.\n\nThese pared-down bands helped foster the bebop style. Rhythm is the distinguishing feature of bebop, and in small groups the drums became more prominent. Setting a driving beat, the drummer interacted with the bass, piano, and the soloists, and together the musicians created fast, complex melodies. Jazz aficionados flocked to such clubs as Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem to soak in the new style. For the young musicians and their fans this was a thrilling turning point in jazz history. However, for the majority of Americans, who just wanted some swinging music to dance to, the advent of bebop was the end of jazz as mainstream music.",

    passage: "This passage details the rise and fall of the Seattle grunge-music sound in American pop culture of the 1990s.\n\nThe late 1980s found the landscape of popular music in America dominated by a distinctive style of rock and roll known as Glam Rock or Hair Metal—so called because of the over-styled hair, makeup, and wardrobe worn by the genre’s ostentatious rockers. Bands like Poison, White Snake, and Mötley Crüe popularized glam rock with their power ballads and flashy style, but the product had worn thin by the early 1990s. The mainstream public, tired of an act they perceived as symbolic of the superficial 1980s, was ready for something with a bit of substance.\n\nIn 1991, a Seattle-based band named Nirvana shocked the corporate music industry with the release of its debut single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” which quickly became a huge hit all over the world. Nirvana’s distorted, guitar-laden sound and thought-provoking lyrics were the antithesis of glam rock, and the youth of America were quick to pledge their allegiance to the brand new movement known as grunge.\n\nGrunge actually got its start in the Pacific Northwest during the mid 1980s, the offspring of the metal-guitar driven rock of the 1970s and the hardcore, punk music of the early 1980s. Nirvana had simply brought into the mainstream a sound and culture that got its start years before with bands like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Green River. Grunge rockers derived their fashion sense from the youth culture of the Pacific Northwest: a melding of punk rock style and outdoors clothing like flannels, heavy boots, worn out jeans, and corduroys. At the height of the movement’s popularity, when other Seattle bands like Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains were all the rage, the trappings of grunge were working their way to the height of American fashion. Like the music, teenagers were fast to embrace the grunge fashion because it represented defiance against corporate America and shallow pop culture.\n\nMany assume that grunge got its name from the unkempt appearance of its musicians and their dirty, often distorted guitar sounds. However, rock writers and critics have used the word “grunge” since the 1970s. While no one can say for sure who was the first to characterize a Seattle band as “grunge,” the most popular theory is that it originated with the lead singer of Mudhoney, Mark Arm. In a practical joke against a local music magazine, he placed advertisements all over Seattle for a band that did not exist. He then wrote a letter to the magazine complaining about the quality of the fake band’s music. The magazine published his critique, one part of which stated, “I hate Mr. Epp and the Calculations! Pure grunge!”\n\nThe popularity of grunge music was ephemeral; by the mid- to late 1990s its influence upon American culture had all but disappeared, and most of its recognizable bands were nowhere to be seen on the charts. The heavy sound and themes of grunge were replaced on the radio waves by bands like NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys, and the bubblegum pop of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThere are many reasons why the Seattle sound faded out of the mainstream as quickly as it rocketed to prominence, but the most glaring reason lies at the defiant, anti-establishment heart of the grunge movement itself. It is very hard to buck the trend when you are the one setting it, and many of the grunge bands were never comfortable with the celebrity that was thrust upon them. One the most successful Seattle groups of the 1990s, Pearl Jam, filmed only one music video, and refused to play large venues. Ultimately, the simple fact that many grunge bands were so against mainstream rock stardom eventually took the movement back to where it started: underground. The American mainstream public, as quick as they were to hop onto the grunge bandwagon, were just as quick to hop off, and move onto something else.",

    passage: "The selection that follows is based on an excerpt from the biography of a music legend.\n\nAlthough Dick Dale is best known for his contributions to surf music, and has been called “King of the Surf Guitar,” he has also been referred to as the “Father of Heavy Metal.” While this title is more often associated with Ozzy Osbourne or Tony Iossa, Dale earned it from Guitar Player Magazine for his unique playing style and pioneering use of Fender guitars and amplifiers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Dale was playing guitar at a club in California, where his one-of-a-kind music turned it from a jazz club into a rock nightspot. After a 1956 concert there, guitar and amplifier maker Leo Fender approached the guitarist and gave him the first Fender Stratocaster to try before the guitar was mass marketed. Fender thought that Dale’s way of playing, a virtual assault on the instrument, would be a good test of its durability. However, the guitar was right-handed and Dale played left-handed. Unfazed, Dale held and played it upside down and backwards (a feat that later strongly influenced Jimi Hendrix).\n\nThe test proved too much for Fender’s equipment. Dale loved the guitar, but blew out the amplifier that came with it. It had worked well for most other musicians, who at that time were playing country and blues. Rock didn’t exist, and no one played the guitar as fiercely as Dale. Fender improved the amplifier, and Dale blew it out again. Before Fender came up with a winner, legend has it that Dale blew up between 40 and 60 amplifiers. Finally, Fender created a special amp just for Dale, known as the “Showman.” It had more than 100 watts of power. The two men then made an agreement that Dale would “road test” prototypes of Fender’s new amplification equipment before they would be manufactured for the general public. But they still had problems with the speakers—every speaker Dale used it with blew up (some even caught fire) because of the intense power of his volume coupled with a staccato playing style.\n\nFender and Dale approached the James B. Lansing speaker company, asking for a fifteen-inch speaker built to their specifications. The company responded with the fifteen-inch JBL-D130F speaker, and it worked. Dale was able to play through the Showman Amp with the volume turned all the way up. With the help of Leo Fender and the designers at Lansing, Dick Dale was able to break through the limits of existing electronics and play the music his way—loud.\n\nBut it wasn’t enough. As Dale’s popularity increased, his shows got larger. He wanted even more sound to fill the larger halls he now played in. Fender had the Triad Company craft an amp tube that peaked at 180 watts, creating another new amplifier for Dale. Dale designed a cabinet to house it along with two Lansing speakers. He called it the Dick Dale Transformer, and it was a scream machine. Dick Dale made music history by playing a new kind of music, and helping to invent the means by which that music could be played. Not only was this the start of the electric movement, but it may also be considered the dawning of heavy metal.",

    passage: "The following passage discusses the unique musical traditions that developed along the Rio Grand in colonial New Mexico.\n\nFrom 1598 to 1821, the area along the Rio Grand that is now the state of New Mexico formed the northernmost border of the Spanish colonies in the New World. The colonists lived on a geographic frontier surrounded by deserts and mountains. This remote colony with its harsh climate was far removed from the cultural centers of the Spanish Empire in the New World, and music was a necessary part of social life. The isolated nature of the region and needs of the community gave rise to a unique, rich musical tradition that included colorful ballads, popular dances, and some of the most extraordinary ceremonial music in the Hispanic world.\n\nThe popular music along the Rio Grand, especially the heroic and romantic ballads, reflected the stark and rough nature of the region. Unlike the refined music found in Mexico, the music of the Rio Grand had a rough-cut “frontier” quality. The music also reflected the mixing of cultures that characterized the border colony. The close military and cultural ties between the Spanish and the native Pueblos of the region led to a uniquely New Mexican fusion of traditions. Much of the music borrowed from both European and native cultures. This mixing of traditions was especially evident in the dances.\n\nThe bailes, or village dances—instrumental music played on violin and guitar—were a lively focus of frontier life. Some bailes were derived from traditional European waltzes, but then adapted to the singular style of the region. The bailes had an unusual melodic structure and the players had unique methods of bowing and tuning their instruments. Other bailes, such as indita (little Indian girl) and vaquero (cowboy), were only found in New Mexico. The rhythms and melodies of the indita had definite Puebloan influences. Its themes, which ranged from love to tragedy, almost always featured dramatic interactions between Spanish and Native Americans. Similarly, the Matachines dance drama was an allegorical representation of the meeting of European and Native American cultures. Its European melodies, played on violin and guitar, were coupled with the use of insistent repetition, which came from the Native American tradition.\n\nIn addition to the bailes, waltzes—the Waltz of the Days and the Waltz of the Immanuels—were also performed to celebrate New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Groups of revelers went singing from house to house throughout the night to bring in the New Year. In New Mexico, January 1 is the Feast of Immanuel so the singers visited the houses of people named Manuel or Manuela. Many songs were sung on these visits but especially popular were the coplas, or improvised couplets, composed on the spot to honor or poke fun of the person being visited.\n\nLike in the New Year’s celebration, music was central to many social rituals in colonial New Mexico. In the Rio Grand region, weddings were performed in song in a folk ceremony called “The Delivery of the Newlyweds.” The community would gather to sanction the new couple and “deliver” them in song to each other and to their respective families. The verses of the song, played to a lively waltz, were improvised, but followed a familiar pattern. The first verses spoke about marriage in general. These were followed by serious and humorous verses offering practical advice to the couple. Then all the guests filed past to bless the couple and concluding verses were sung to honor specific individuals such as the best man. At the wedding dance, la marcha was performed. In this triumphal march, couples formed into single files of men and women. After dancing in concentric circles, the men and women lined up opposite one another with their hands joined overhead to form a tunnel of love from which the new couple was the last to emerge.\n\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, styles were evolving and musical forms popular in previous eras were giving way to new tastes. The ancient romance ballads were replaced by newer forms that featured more local and contemporary events. The extraordinary indita was no longer performed and the canción, or popular song, had begun its rise. However, many of the wedding traditions of the colonial era are still in practice today. The music that was so central to life in the remote colony of New Mexico has much to teach us about the unique and vibrant culture that once flourished there.",

    passage: "In Passage 1, the author describes the life and influence of blues guitarist Robert Johnson. In Passage 2, the author provides a brief history of the blues.\n\nPASSAGE 1\nThere is little information available about the legendary blues guitarist Robert Johnson, and the information that is available is as much rumor as fact. What is undisputable, however, is Johnson’s impact on the world of rock and roll. Some consider Johnson the father of modern rock; his influence extends to artists from Muddy Waters to Led Zeppelin, from the Rolling Stones to the Allman Brothers Band. Eric Clapton, arguably the greatest living rock guitarist, has said that “Robert Johnson to me is the most important blues musician who ever lived. [ . . . ] I have never found anything more deeply soulful than Robert Johnson.” While the impact of Johnson’s music is evident, the genesis of his remarkable talent remains shrouded in mystery.\nFor Johnson, born in 1911 in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, music was a means of escape from working in the cotton fields. As a boy he worked on the farm that belonged to Noel Johnson—the man rumored to be his father. He married young, at age 17, and lost his wife a year later in childbirth. That’s when Johnson began traveling and playing the blues.\nInitially Johnson played the harmonica. Later, he began playing the guitar, but apparently he was not very good. He wanted to learn, however, so he spent his time in blues bars watching the local blues legends Son House and Willie Brown. During their breaks, Johnson would go up on stage and play. House reportedly thought Johnson was so bad that he repeatedly told Johnson to get lost. Finally, one day, he did. For six months, Johnson mysteriously disappeared. No one knew what happened to him.\nWhen Johnson returned half a year later, he was suddenly a first-rate guitarist. He began drawing crowds everywhere he played. Johnson never revealed where he had been and what he had done in those six months that he was gone. People had difficulty understanding how he had become so good in such a short time. Was it genius? Magic? Soon, rumors began circulating that he had made a deal with the devil. Legend has it that Johnson met the devil at midnight at a crossroads and sold his soul to the devil so he could play guitar.\nJohnson recorded only 29 songs before his death in 1938, purportedly at the hands of a jealous husband. He was only 27 years old, yet he left an indelible mark on the music world. There are countless versions of “Walkin’ Blues,” and his song “Cross Road Blues” (later retitled “Crossroads”) has been recorded by dozens of artists, with Cream’s 1969 version of “Crossroads” being perhaps the best-known Johnson remake. Again and again, contemporary artists return to Johnson, whose songs capture the very essence of the blues, transforming our pain and suffering with the healing magic of his guitar.\n\nPASSAGE 2\nThere are more than fifty types of blues music, from the famous Chicago and Memphis Blues to the less familiar Juke Joint and Acoustic Country Blues. This rich variety comes as no surprise to those who recognize the blues as a fundamental American art form. Indeed, in its resolution to name 2003 the Year of the Blues, the 107th Congress has declared that the blues is “the most influential form of American roots music.” In fact, the two most popular American musical forms—rock and roll and jazz—owe their genesis in large part (some would argue entirely) to the blues.\nThe blues—a neologism attributed to the American writer Washington Irving (author of “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”) in 1807—evolved from black American folk music. Its beginnings can be traced to songs sung in the fields and around slave quarters on southern plantations, songs of pain and suffering, of injustice, of longing for a better life. A fundamental principle of the blues, however, is that the music be cathartic. Listening to the blues will drive the blues away; it is music that has the power to overcome sadness. Thus “the blues” is something of a misnomer, for the music is moving but not melancholy; it is, in fact, music born of hope, not despair.\nThe blues began to take shape as a musical movement in the years after emancipation, around the turn of the century when blacks were technically free but still suffered from social and economic discrimination. Its poetic and musical forms were popularized by W. C. Handy just after the turn of the century. Handy, a classical guitarist who reportedly heard the blues for the first time in a Mississippi train station, was the first to officially compose and distribute “blues” music throughout the United States, although its popularity was chiefly among blacks in the South. The movement coalesced in the late 1920s and indeed became a national craze with records by blues singers such as Bessie Smith selling in the millions.\nThe 1930s and 1940s saw a continued growth in the popularity of the blues as many blacks migrated north and the blues and jazz forms continued to develop, diversify, and influence each other. It was at this time that Son House, Willie Brown, and Robert Johnson played, while the next decade saw the emergence of the blues greats Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Johnny Lee Hooker.\nAfter rock and roll exploded on the music scene in the 1950s, many rock artists began covering blues songs, thus bringing the blues to a young white audience and giving it true national and international exposure. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Cream, and others remade blues songs such as Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads” and Big Joe Williams’ “Baby Please Don’t Go” to wide popularity. People all across America—black and white, young and old, listened to songs with lyrics that were intensely honest and personal, songs that told about any number of things that give us the blues: loneliness, betrayal, unrequited love, a run of bad luck, being out of work or away from home or broke or broken hearted. It was a music perfectly suited for a nation on the brink of the Civil Rights movement—a kind of music that had the power to cross boundaries, to heal wounds, and to offer hope to a new generation of Americans.",

    passage: "This passage describes the formative experiences of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThe composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s remarkable musical talent was apparent even before most children can sing a simple nursery rhyme. Wolfgang’s older sister Maria Anna, who the family called Nannerl, was learning the clavier, an early keyboard instrument, when her three-year-old brother took an interest in playing. As Nannerl later recalled, Wolfgang “often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was always striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good.” Their father Leopold, an assistant concertmaster at the Salzburg Court, recognized his children’s unique gifts and soon devoted himself to their musical education.\n\nBorn in Salzburg, Austria, on January 27, 1756, Wolfgang was five when he learned his first musical composition—in less than half an hour. He quickly learned other pieces, and by age five composed his first original work. Leopold settled on a plan to take Nannerl and Wolfgang on tour to play before the European courts. Their first venture was to nearby Munich where the children played for Maximillian III Joseph, elector of Bavaria. Leopold soon set his sights on the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, Vienna. On their way to Vienna, the family stopped in Linz, where Wolfgang gave his first public concert. By this time, Wolfgang was not only a virtuoso harpsichord player but he had also mastered the violin. The audience at Linz was stunned by the six-year-old, and word of his genius soon traveled to Vienna. In a much-anticipated concert, the children appeared at the Schönbrunn Palace on October 13, 1762. They utterly charmed the emperor and empress.\n\nFollowing this success, Leopold was inundated with invitations for the children to play, for a fee. Leopold seized the opportunity and booked as many concerts as possible at courts throughout Europe. After the children performed at the major court in a region, other nobles competed to have the “miracle children of Salzburg” play a private concert in their homes. A concert could last three hours, and the children played at least two a day. Today, Leopold might be considered the worst kind of stage parent, but at the time it was not uncommon for prodigies to make extensive concert tours. Even so, it was an exhausting schedule for a child who was just past the age of needing an afternoon nap.\n\nWolfgang fell ill on tour, and when the family returned to Salzburg on January 5, 1763, Wolfgang spent his first week at home in bed with acute rheumatoid arthritis. In June, Leopold accepted an invitation for the children to play at Versailles, the lavish palace built by Loius XIV, king of France. Wolfgang did not see his home in Salzburg for another three years. When they weren’t performing, the Mozart children were likely to be found bumping along the rutted roads in an unheated carriage. Wolfgang passed the long uncomfortable hours in the imaginary Kingdom of Back, of which he was king. He became so engrossed in the intricacies of his make-believe court that he persuaded a family servant to make a map showing all the cities, villages, and towns over which he reigned.\n\nThe king of Back was also busy composing. Wolfgang completed his first symphony at age nine and published his first sonatas that same year. Before the family returned to Salzburg, Wolfgang had played for, and amazed, the heads of the French and British royal families. He had also been plagued with numerous illnesses. Despite Wolfgang and Nannerl’s arduous schedule and international renown, the family’s finances were often strained. The pattern established in his childhood would be the template for the rest of his short life. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart toiled constantly, was lauded for his genius, suffered from illness, and struggled financially, until he died at age 35. The remarkable child prodigy who more than fulfilled his potential was buried in an unmarked grave, as was the custom at the time, in a Vienna suburb.",

    passage: `Time is running out for the old-growth forests of Finland. The vast majority of Finland’s valuable old-growth forest is owned by the state and logged by the state-owned company Metsähallitus. Metsähallitus’ logging practices include clearcutting, logging in habitats of threatened and vulnerable species, and logging in areas of special scenic or cultural value—including in areas that are critical for the reindeer herding of the indigenous Sami people.

Despite being involved in a “dialogue process” with two environmental organizations (World Wildlife Fund and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation), to try and reach agreement regarding additional protection for old-growth forests, Metsähallitus is now logging sites that should be subject to negotiation.

In June 2003, Greenpeace and the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) presented comprehensive maps of the old-growth areas that should be subject to moratorium, pending discussion and additional protection, to all those involved in the dialogue process. Metsähallitus then announced a halt to new logging operations in these mapped areas. Sadly, the halt in logging was short lived. In August and September logging took place in at least six old-growth forest areas in Northern Finland.

It seems Metsähallitus wants to have its cake and eat it too—friendly talks with environmental groups at the same time they keep logging critical habitat. To be blunt, their commitment to the dialog process has proven untrustworthy. The new logging has been without consensus from the dialog process or proper consultation with the Sami reindeer herders. Now there’s a risk the logging will expand to include other old-growth areas.

Greenpeace investigations have revealed a number of companies buying old-growth timber from Metsähallitus, but the great majority goes to Finland’s three international paper manufacturers, Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene, and M-Real. Greenpeace recommends that companies ask for written guarantees that no material from any of the recently mapped old-growth areas is entering or will enter their supply chain, pending the switch to only timber that has been independently certified to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council in order to stop this risk to protected forests.`,

    passage: `Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. Consisting of both living and non-living components, this type of ecosystem is found in the warm, clear, shallow waters of tropical oceans worldwide. The functionality of the reefs ranges from providing food and shelter to fish and other forms of marine life to protecting the shore from the ill effects of erosion and putrefaction. In fact, reefs actually create land in tropical areas by formulating islands and contributing mass to continental shorelines.

Although coral looks like a plant, actually it is mainly comprised of the limestone skeleton of a tiny animal called a coral polyp. While corals are the main components of reef structure, they are not the only living participants. Coralline algae cement the myriad corals, and other miniature organisms such as tube worms and mollusks contribute skeletons to this dense and diverse structure. Together, these living creatures construct many different types of tropical reefs.

Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest network of coral reefs, stretching 2,010 km (1,250 miles) off Australia’s northeastern coast. From microorganisms to whales, diverse life forms make their home on the reef. Over 1,500 fish species, 4,000 mollusk species, 200 bird species, 16 sea snake species, and six sea turtle species thrive in the reef’s tropical waters. The reef is also a habitat for the endangered dugong (sea cow), moray eels, and sharks. In addition to crawling with animal life, the coral reef offers the viewer a spectrum of brilliant colors and intricate shapes, a virtual underwater, writhing garden.

Although protected by the Australian government, Great Barrier Reef faces environmental threats. Crown-of-thorns starfish feed on coral and can destroy large portions of reef. Pollution and rising water temperatures also threaten the delicate coral. But the most preventable of the hazards to the reef are tourists. Tourists have contributed to the destruction of the reef ecosystem by breaking off and removing pieces of coral to bring home as souvenirs. The government hopes that by informing tourists of the dangers of this seemingly harmless activity they will quash this creeping menace to the fragile reef.`,

    passage: "For centuries time was measured by the position of the sun with the use of sundials. Noon was recognized when the sun was the highest in the sky, and cities would set their clock by this Apparent Solar Time, even though some cities would often be on a slightly different time. “Summer time” or Daylight Saving Time (DST) was instituted to make better use of daylight. Thus, clocks are set forward one hour in the spring to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening and then set back one hour in the fall to return to normal daylight.\n\nBenjamin Franklin first conceived the idea of daylight saving during his tenure as an American delegate in Paris in 1784 and wrote about it extensively in his essay, “An Economical Project.” It is said that Franklin awoke early one morning and was surprised to see the sunlight at such an hour. Always the economist, Franklin believed the practice of moving the time could save on the use of candlelight as candles were expensive at the time. In England, builder William Willett (1857–1915), became a strong supporter for Daylight Saving Time upon noticing blinds of many houses were closed on an early sunny morning. Willett believed everyone, including himself, would appreciate longer hours of light in the evenings. In 1909, Sir Robert Pearce introduced a bill in the House of Commons to make it obligatory to adjust the clocks. A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, it was decided that summer time should begin on the day following the third Saturday in April and close after the first Saturday in October.\n\nThe United States Congress passed the Standard Time Act of 1918 to establish standard time and preserve and set Daylight Saving Time across the continent. This act also devised five time zones throughout the United States: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, and Alaska. The first time zone was set on “the mean astronomical time of the seventy-fifth degree of longitude west from Greenwich” (England). In 1919 this act was repealed. President Roosevelt established year-round Daylight Saving Time (also called “War Time”) from 1942–1945. However, after this period each state adopted their own DST, which proved to be disconcerting to television and radio broadcasting and transportation. In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Department of Transportation and signed the Uniform Time Act. As a result, the Department of Transportation was given the responsibility for the time laws. During the oil embargo and energy crisis of the 1970s, President Richard Nixon extended DST through the Daylight Saving Time Energy Act of 1973 to conserve energy further. This law was modified in 1986, and Daylight Saving Time was set for beginning on the first Sunday in April (to “spring ahead”) and ending on the last Sunday in October (to “fall back”).\n\nThrough the years the U.S. Department of Transportation conducted polls concerning daylight saving time and found that many Americans were in favor of it because of the extended hours of daylight and the freedom to do more in the evening hours. In further studies the U.S. Department of Transportation also found that DST conserves energy by cutting the electricity usage in the morning and evening for lights and particular appliances. During the darkest winter months (November through February), the advantage of conserving energy in afternoon daylight saving time is outweighed by needing more light in the morning because of late sunrise. In Britain, studies showed that there were fewer accidents on the road because of the increased visibility resulting from additional hours of daylight.\n\nDespite these advantages, there is still opposition to DST. One perpetual complaint is the inconvenience of changing many clocks, and adjusting to a new sleep schedule. Farmers often wake at sunrise and find that their animals do not adjust to the changing of time until weeks after the clock is either moved forward or back. In Israel, Sephardic Jews have campaigned against Daylight Saving Time because they recite prayers in the early morning during the Jewish month of Elul. Many places around the globe still do not observe daylight saving time—such as Arizona (excluding Navajo reservations), the five counties in Indiana, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Japan, and Saskatchewan, Canada. Countries located near the equator have equal hours of day and night and do not participate in Daylight Saving Time.",

    passage: "Tradition has it that Newton was sitting under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head, and this made him understand that earthly and celestial gravitation are the same. A contemporary writer, William Stukeley, recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on April 15, 1726, in which Newton recalled “when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth’s centre.”\n\nSir Isaac Newton, English mathematician, philosopher, and physicist, was born in 1642 in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father had died three months before Newton’s birth, and two years later his mother went to live with her new husband, leaving her son in the care of his grandmother. Newton was educated at Grantham Grammar School. In 1661 he joined Trinity College, Cambridge, and continued there as Lucasian professor of mathematics from 1669 to 1701. At that time the college’s teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus, and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become calculus.\n\nHowever, his most important discoveries were made during the two-year period from 1664 to 1666, when the university was closed due to the Great Plague. Newton retreated to his hometown and set to work on developing calculus, as well as advanced studies on optics and gravitation. It was at this time that he discovered the Law of Universal Gravitation and discovered that white light is composed of all the colors of the spectrum. These findings enabled him to make fundamental contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and theoretical and experimental physics.\n\nArguably, it is for Newton’s Laws of Motion that he is most revered. These are the three basic laws that govern the motion of material objects. Together, they gave rise to a general view of nature known as the clockwork universe. The laws are: (1) Every object moves in a straight line unless acted upon by a force. (2) The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force exerted and inversely proportional to the object’s mass. (3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nIn 1687, Newton summarized his discoveries in terrestrial and celestial mechanics in his Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), one of the greatest milestones in the history of science. In this work he showed how his principle of universal gravitation provided an explanation both of falling bodies on the earth and of the motions of planets, comets, and other bodies in the heavens. The first part of the Principia, devoted to dynamics, includes Newton’s three laws of motion; the second part to fluid motion and other topics; and the third part to the system of the world, in which, among other things, he provides an explanation of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.\n\nThis is not all of Newton’s groundbreaking work. In 1704, his discoveries in optics were presented in Opticks, in which he elaborated his theory that light is composed of corpuscles, or particles. Among his other accomplishments were his construction (1668) of a reflecting telescope and his anticipation of the calculus of variations, founded by Gottfried Leibniz and the Bernoullis. In later years, Newton considered mathematics and physics a recreation and turned much of his energy toward alchemy, theology, and history, particularly problems of chronology. Newton achieved many honors over his years of service to the advancement of science and mathematics, as well as for his role as warden, then master, of the mint. He represented Cambridge University in Parliament, and was president of the Royal Society from 1703 until his death in 1727. Sir Isaac Newton was knighted in 1705 by Queen Anne. Newton never married, nor had any recorded children. He died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey.",

    passage: "Few words in a contractor’s vocabulary carry more negative connotations than asbestos. According to the Asbestos Network, “touted as a miracle substance,” asbestos is the generic term for several naturally occurring mineral fibers mined primarily for use as fireproof insulation. Known for strength, flexibility, low electrical conductivity, and resistance to heat, asbestos is comprised of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and assorted metals. Before the public knew asbestos could be harmful to one’s health, it was found in a variety of products to strengthen them and to provide insulation and fire resistance.\n\nAsbestos is generally made up of fiber bundles that can be broken up into long, thin fibers. We now know from various studies that when this friable substance is released into the air and inhaled into the lungs over a period of time, it can lead to a higher risk of lung cancer and a condition known as asbestosis. Asbestosis, a thickening and scarring of the lung tissue, usually occurs when a person is exposed to high asbestos levels over an extensive period of time. Unfortunately, the symptoms do not usually appear until about twenty years after initial exposure, making it difficult to reverse or prevent. In addition, smoking while exposed to asbestos fibers could further increase the risk of developing lung cancer.\n\nWhen it comes to asbestos exposure in the home, school, and workplace, there is no safe level; any exposure is considered harmful and dangerous. Prior to the 1970s asbestos use was ubiquitous—many commercial building and home insulation products contained asbestos. In the home in particular, there are many places where asbestos hazards might be present. Building materials that may contain asbestos include fireproofing material (sprayed on beams), insulation material (on pipes and oil and coal furnaces), acoustical or soundproofing material (sprayed onto ceilings and walls), and in miscellaneous materials, such as asphalt, vinyl, and cement to make products like roofing felts, shingles, siding, wallboard, and floor tiles.\n\nWe advise homeowners and concerned consumers to examine material in their homes if they suspect it may contain asbestos. If the material is in good condition, fibers will not break down, releasing the chemical debris that may be a danger to members of the household. Asbestos is a powerful substance and should be handled by an expert. Do not touch or disturb the material—it may then become damaged and release fibers. Contact local health, environmental, or other appropriate officials to find out proper handling and disposal procedures, if warranted. If asbestos removal or repair is needed you should contact a professional.\n\nAsbestos contained in high-traffic public buildings, such as schools presents the opportunity for disturbance and potential exposure to students and employees. To protect individuals, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) was signed in 1986. This law requires public and private non-profit primary and secondary schools to inspect their buildings for asbestos-containing building materials. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations for schools to follow in order to protect against asbestos contamination and provide assistance to meet the AHERA requirements. These include performing an original inspection and periodic re-inspections every three years for asbestos containing material; developing, maintaining, and updating an asbestos management plan at the school; providing yearly notification to parent, teacher, and employee organizations regarding the availability of the school’s asbestos management plan and any asbestos abatement actions taken or planned in the school; designating a contact person to ensure the responsibilities of the local education agency are properly implemented; performing periodic surveillance of known or suspected asbestos-containing building material; and providing custodial staff with asbestos awareness training.",

    id: "p55-phi",
    passage: "PASSAGE 1\nPHI, the Divine Proportion of 1.618, was described by the astronomer Johannes Kepler as one of the “two great treasures of geometry.” (The other is the Pythagorean theorem.)\n\nPHI is the ratio of any two sequential numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. If you take the numbers 0 and 1, then create each subsequent number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers, you get the Fibonacci sequence. For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144. If you sum the squares of any series of Fibonacci numbers, they will equal the last Fibonacci number used in the series times the next Fibonacci number. This property results in the Fibonacci spiral seen in everything from seashells to galaxies, and is written mathematically as: 1² + 1² + 2² + 3² + 5² = 5 × 8.\n\nPlants illustrate the Fibonacci series in the numbers of leaves, the arrangement of leaves around the stem, and in the positioning of leaves, sections, and seeds. A sunflower seed illustrates this principal as the number of clockwise spirals is 55 and the number of counterclockwise spirals is 89; 89 divided by 55 = 1.618, the Divine Proportion. Pinecones and pineapples illustrate similar spirals of successive Fibonacci numbers.\n\nPHI is also the ratio of five-sided symmetry. It can be proven by using a basic geometrical figure, the pentagon. This five-sided figure embodies PHI because PHI is the ratio of any diagonal to any side of the pentagon—1.618. Say you have a regular pentagon ABCDE with equal sides and equal angles. You may draw a diagonal as line AC connecting any two vertexes of the pentagon. You can then install a total of five such lines, and they are all of equal length. Divide the length of a diagonal AC by the length of a side AB, and you will have an accurate numerical value for PHI—1.618. You can draw a second diagonal line, BC inside the pentagon so that this new line crosses the first diagonal at point O. What occurs is this: Each diagonal is divided into two parts, and each part is in PHI ratio (1.618) to the other, and to the whole diagonal—the PHI ratio recurs every time any diagonal is divided by another diagonal.\n\nWhen you draw all five pentagon diagonals, they form a five-point star: a pentacle. Inside this star is a smaller, inverted pentagon. Each diagonal is crossed by two other diagonals, and each segment is in PHI ratio to the larger segments and to the whole. Also, the inverted inner pentagon is in PHI ratio to the initial outer pentagon. Thus, PHI is the ratio of five-sided symmetry.\n\nInscribe the pentacle star inside a pentagon and you have the pentagram, symbol of the ancient Greek School of Mathematics founded by Pythagoras—solid evidence that the ancient Mystery Schools knew about PHI and appreciated the Divine Proportion’s multitude of uses to form our physical and biological worlds.\n\nPASSAGE 2\nLangdon turned to face his sea of eager students. “Who can tell me what this number is?”\nA long-legged math major in back raised his hand. “That’s the number PHI.” He pronounced it fee.\n“Nice job, Stettner,” Langdon said. “Everyone, meet PHI.” [ . . . ]\n“This number PHI,” Langdon continued, “one-point-six-one-eight, is a very important number in art. Who can tell me why?” [ . . . ]\n“Actually,” Langdon said, [ . . . ] “PHI is generally considered the most beautiful number in the universe.” [ . . . ] As Langdon loaded his slide projector, he explained that the number PHI was derived from the Fibonacci sequence—a progression famous not only because the sum of adjacent terms equaled the next term, but because the quotients of adjacent terms possessed the astonishing property of approaching the number 1.618—PHI!\n\nDespite PHI’s seemingly mystical mathematical origins, Langdon explained, the truly mind-boggling aspect of PHI was its role as a fundamental building block in nature. Plants, animals, even human beings all possessed dimensional properties that adhered with eerie exactitude to the ratio of PHI to 1.\n“PHI’s ubiquity in nature clearly exceeds coincidence, and so the ancients assumed the number PHI must have been preordained by the creator of the universe. Early scientists heralded 1.618 as the Divine Proportion.”\n[ . . . ] Langdon advanced to the next slide—a close-up of a sunflower’s seed head. “Sunflower seeds grow in opposing spirals. Can you guess the ratio of each rotation’s diameter to the next?\n“1.618.”\n“Bingo.” Langdon began racing through slides now—spiraled pinecone petals, leaf arrangement on plant stalks, insect segmentation—all displaying astonishing obedience to the Divine Proportion.\n“This is amazing!” someone cried out.\n“Yeah,” someone else said, “but what does it have to do with art?”\n[ . . . ] “Nobody understood better than da Vinci the divine structure of the human body. . . . He was the first to show that the human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional ratios always equal PHI.”\nEveryone in class gave him a dubious look.\n“Don’t believe me? . . . Try it. Measure the distance from your shoulder to your fingertips, and then divide it by the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. PHI again. Another? Hip to floor divided by knee to floor. PHI again. Finger joints. Toes. Spinal divisions. PHI, PHI, PHI. My friends, each of you is a walking tribute to the Divine Proportion.”\n[ . . . .]”In closing,” Langdon said, “we return to symbols.” He drew five intersecting lines that formed a five-pointed star. “This symbol is one of the most powerful images you will see this term. Formally known as a pentagram—or pentacle, as the ancients called it—the symbol is considered both divine and magical by many cultures. Can anyone tell me why that may be?”\nStettner, the math major, raised his hand. “Because if you draw a pentagram, the lines automatically divide themselves into segments according to the Divine Proportion.”\nLandgon gave the kid a proud nod. “Nice job. Yes, the ratios of line segments in a pentacle all equal PHI, making the symbol the ultimate expression of the Divine Proportion.”",

    passage: "Ivory skin, ivory teeth, Ivory Soap, Ivory Snow—we hear “ivory” used all the time to describe something fair, white, and pure. But where does ivory come from, and what exactly is it? Is it natural or man-made? Is it a modifier, meaning something pure and white or is it a specialized and discrete substance?\n\nHistorically, the word ivory has been applied to the tusks of elephants. However, the chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same regardless of the species of origin, and the trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread. Therefore, ivory can correctly be used to describe any mammalian tooth or tusk of commercial interest that is large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. Teeth and tusks have the same origins. Teeth are specialized structures adapted for food mastication. Tusks, which are extremely large teeth projecting beyond the lips, have evolved from teeth and give certain species an evolutionary advantage that goes beyond chewing and breaking down food in digestible pieces. Furthermore, the tusk can be used to actually secure food through hunting, killing, and then breaking up large chunks of food into manageable bits.\n\nThe teeth of most mammals consist of a root as well as the tusk proper. Teeth and tusks have the same physical structures: pulp cavity, dentine, cementum, and enamel. The innermost area is the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity is an empty space within the tooth that conforms to the shape of the pulp. Odontoblastic cells line the pulp cavity and are responsible for the production of dentine. Dentine, which is the main component of carved ivory objects, forms a layer of consistent thickness around the pulp cavity and comprises the bulk of the tooth and tusk. Dentine is a mineralized connective tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. The inorganic component of dentine consists of dahllite. Dentine contains a microscopic structure called dentinal tubules which are micro-canals that radiate outward through the dentine from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum border. These canals have different configurations in different ivories and their diameter ranges between 0.8 and 2.2 microns. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tusk. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is under genetic control and is therefore a characteristic unique to the order of the mammal.\n\nExterior to the dentine lies the cementum layer. Cementum forms a layer surrounding the dentine of tooth and tusk roots. Its main function is to adhere the tooth and tusk root to the mandibular and maxillary jaw bones. Incremental lines are commonly seen in cementum. Enamel, the hardest animal tissue, covers the surface of the tooth or tusk which receives the most wear, such as the tip or crown. Ameloblasts are responsible for the formation of enamel and are lost after the enamel process is complete. Enamel exhibits a prismatic structure with prisms that run perpendicular to the crown or tip. Enamel prism patterns can have both taxonomic and evolutionary significance.\n\nTooth and tusk ivory can be carved into an almost infinite variety of shapes and objects. A small example of carved ivory objects are small statuary, netsukes, jewelry, flatware handles, furniture inlays, and piano keys. Additionally, wart hog tusks, and teeth from sperm whales, killer whales, and hippos can also be scrimshawed or superficially carved, thus retaining their original shapes as morphologically recognizable objects. The identification of ivory and ivory substitutes is based on the physical and chemical class characteristics of these materials. A common approach to identification is to use the macroscopic and microscopic physical characteristics of ivory in combination with a simple chemical test using ultraviolet light.",

    passage: "The scientific method usually refers to either a series or a collection of processes that are considered characteristic of scientific investigation and of the acquisition of new scientific knowledge. The essential elements of the scientific method are:\nObserve: Observe or read about a phenomenon.\nHypothesize: Wonder about your observations, and invent a hypothesis, or a guess, which could explain the phenomenon or set of facts that you have observed.\nTest: Conduct tests to try out your hypothesis.\nPredict: Use the logical consequences of your hypothesis to predict observations of new phenomena or results of new measurements.\nExperiment: Perform experiments to test the accuracy of these predictions.\nConclude: Accept or refute your hypothesis.\nEvaluate: Search for other possible explanations of the result until you can show that your guess was indeed the explanation, with confidence.\nFormulate new hypothesis: as required.\n\nThis idealized process is often misinterpreted as applying to scientists individually rather than to the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science is a social activity, and one scientist’s theory or proposal cannot become accepted unless it has been published, peer reviewed, criticized, and finally accepted by the scientific community.\n\nObservation\nThe scientific method begins with observation. Observation often demands careful measurement. It also requires the establishment of an operational definition of measurements and other concepts before the experiment begins.\n\nHypothesis\nTo explain the observation, scientists use whatever they can (their own creativity, ideas from other fields, or even systematic guessing) to come up with possible explanations for the phenomenon under study. Deductive reasoning is the way in which predictions are used to test a hypothesis.\n\nTesting\nIn the twentieth century, philosopher Karl Popper introduced the idea that a hypothesis must be falsifiable; that is, it must be capable of being demonstrated wrong. A hypothesis must make specific predictions; these predictions can be tested with concrete measurements to support or refute the hypothesis. For instance, Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity makes a few specific predictions about the structure of space and flow of time, such as the prediction that light bends in a strong gravitational field, and the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of the gravitational field. Observations made of a 1919 solar eclipse supported this hypothesis against other possible hypotheses, such as Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity, which did not make such a prediction. British astronomers used the eclipse to prove Einstein’s theory and therefore, eventually replaced Newton’s theory.\n\nVerification\nProbably the most important aspect of scientific reasoning is verification. Verification is the process of determining whether the hypothesis is in accord with empirical evidence, and whether it will continue to be in accord with a more generally expanded body of evidence. Ideally, the experiments performed should be fully described so that anyone can reproduce them, and many scientists should independently verify every hypothesis. Results that can be obtained from experiments performed by many are termed reproducible and are given much greater weight in evaluating hypotheses than non-reproducible results.\n\nEvaluation\nFalsificationism argues that any hypothesis, no matter how respected or time-honored, must be discarded once it is contradicted by new reliable evidence. This is, of course, an oversimplification, since individual scientists inevitably hold on to their pet theory long after contrary evidence has been found. This is not always a bad thing. Any theory can be made to correspond to the facts, simply by making a few adjustments—called “auxiliary hypothesis”—so as to bring it into correspondence with the accepted observations. The choice of when to reject one theory and accept another is inevitably up to the individual scientist, rather than some methodical law. Hence all scientific knowledge is always in a state of flux, for at any time new evidence could be present[ed] that contradicts long-held hypotheses.\nThe experiments that reject a hypothesis should be performed by many different scientists to guard against bias, mistake, misunderstanding, and fraud. Scientific journals use a process of peer review, in which scientists submit their results to a panel of fellow scientists (who may or may not know the identity of the writer) for evaluation. Peer review may well have turned up problems and led to a closer examination of experimental evidence for many scientists. Much embarrassment, and wasted effort worldwide, has been avoided by objective peer review, in addition to continuing the use and proving the necessity of the scientific method.",

    passage: "The seemingly simple question of “what defines a sport?” has been the fodder for argument and conversation for years, among professional and armchair athletes alike. There seems to be no doubt that vigorous and highly competitive activities such as baseball, football, and soccer are truly “sports,” but when the subject of other activities such as darts, chess, and shuffleboard is broached we find ourselves at the heart of a controversy.\n\nIf say, billiards, is not a sport, then what exactly is it? Those who would dispute it to be a sport would respond that it is a simple leisure activity. They would go on to claim a true sport first and foremost requires some form of physical exertion. More to the point, if a player does not break a sweat, what he or she plays is not a sport. Beyond that, more important criteria would be the need for decent hand-eye coordination, and the ever-present possibility of sustaining injury. Billiards only fits one of those specifications (hand-eye coordination), so according to the doubters, it is not a real sport.\n\nTo help resolve this dispute, the first text to consult would have to be the dictionary. According to one dictionary, a sport is defined as “a diversion” or a “recreation.” Assuming one strictly adheres to the simple guidelines laid out in that definition, it would seem that almost any activity that provides enjoyment could be classified as a sport. And if, according to the dictionary, watching a sport on television is a sport itself, I guess that would make a couch potato an athlete. Play ball!",

    passage: "The roots of the modern-day sport of lacrosse are found in tribal stick and ball games developed and played by many native North American tribes dating back as early as the fifteenth century. The Native American names for these games reflected the bellicose nature of those early contests, many of which went far beyond friendly recreational competition. For example, the Algonquin called their game Baggattaway, which meant, “they bump hips.” The Cherokee Nation and the Six Tribes of the Iroquois called their sport Tewaarathon, which translated into “Little Brother of War.” Rules and style of play differed from tribe to tribe and games could be played by as few as fifteen to as many as 1,000 men and women at a time. These matches could last for three days, beginning at dawn each day and ending at sunset. The goals could be specific trees or rocks, and were a few hundred yards to a few miles apart. Despite these differences, the sole object of every game was the same: to score goals by any means necessary. Serious injuries caused by blows from the heavy wooden sticks used in the games were not uncommon, and often expected. Not surprisingly, the Native Americans considered these precursors to today’s lacrosse excellent battle preparation for young warriors, and games were often used to settle disputes between tribes without resorting to full-blown warfare. For the Six Tribes of the Iroquois, certain matches of Tewaarathon held religious significance, as well. One of the most important gods the Iroquois worshipped was the Creator, Deganawidah. In Iroquois legend, the Creator united the Six Tribes into the one nation. Tewaarathon was played to please the Creator, and the competition was viewed as a recreation of the Iroquois Creation Story, where supernatural forces of good and evil battled each other in an epic struggle.",

    passage: "Traditional body signage seems largely to have disappeared. Well, many of the old symbols and names are still around, of course, but they are part of the commercial range of options. Seeing someone in a Harvard or Oxford sweatshirt or a kilt or a military tie now communicates nothing at all significant about that person’s life other than the personal choice of a particular consumer. Religious signs are still evocative, to be sure, but are far less common than they used to be. Why should this be? I suspect one reason may be that we have lost a sense of significant connection to the various things indicated by such signs. Proclaiming our high school or university or our athletic team or our community has a much lower priority nowadays, in part because we live such rapidly changing lives in a society marked by constant motion that the stability essential to confer significance on such signs has largely gone. But we still must attach ourselves to something. Lacking the conviction that the traditional things matter, we turn to the last resort of the modern world: the market. Here there is a vast array of options, all equally meaningless in terms of traditional values, all equally important in identifying the one thing left to us for declaring our identity publicly, our fashion sense and disposable income. The market naturally manipulates the labels, making sure we keep purchasing what will most quickly declare us excellent consumers.

    passage: "A wave is a communicated agitation. The water that composes the body of a wave does not move. If it did, when a stone is thrown into a pond and the ripples spread away in an ever-widening circle, there would appear at the center an ever-increasing hole. No, the water that composes the body of a wave is stationary. Thus, you may watch a particular portion of the ocean’s surface and you will see the same water rise and fall a thousand times to the agitation communicated by a thousand successive waves. Now imagine this communicated agitation moving shoreward. As the bottom shoals, the lower portion of the wave strikes land first and is stopped. But water is fluid, and the upper portion has not struck anything, wherefore it keeps on communicating its agitation, keeps on going. And when the top of the wave keeps on going, while the bottom of it lags behind, something is bound to happen. The bottom of the wave drops out from under and the top of the wave falls over, forward, and down, curling and cresting and roaring as it does so. It is the bottom of a wave striking against the top of the land that is the cause of all surfs. But the transformation from a smooth undulation to a breaker is not abrupt except where the bottom shoals abruptly. Say the bottom shoals gradually from a quarter of a mile to a mile, then an equal distance will be occupied by the transformation. Such a bottom is that off the beach of Waikiki, and it produces a splendid, surf-riding surf. One leaps upon the back of a breaker just as it begins to break, and stays on it as it continues to break all the way in to shore. And now to the particular physics of surf-riding. Get out on a flat board, six feet long, two feet wide, and roughly oval in shape. Lie down upon it like a small boy on a coaster and paddle with your hands out to deep water, where the waves begin to crest. Lie out there quietly on the board. Sea after sea breaks before, behind, and under and over you, and rushes in to shore, leaving you behind. When a wave crests, it gets steeper. Imagine yourself, on your board, on the face of that steep slope. If it stood still, you would slide down just as a boy slides down a hill on his coaster. “But,” you object, “the wave doesn’t stand still.” Very true, but the water composing the wave stands still, and there you have the secret. If ever you start sliding down the face of that wave, you’ll keep on sliding and you’ll never reach the bottom. Please don’t laugh. The face of that wave may be only six feet, yet you can slide down it a quarter of a mile, or half a mile, and not reach the bottom. For, see, since a wave is only a communicated agitation or impetus, and since the water that composes a wave is changing every instant, new water is rising into the wave as fast as the wave travels. You slide down this new water, and yet remain in your old position on the wave, sliding down the still newer water that is rising and forming the wave. You slide precisely as fast as the wave travels. If it travels fifteen miles an hour, you slide fifteen miles an hour. Between you and shore stretches a quarter of mile of water. As the wave travels, this water obligingly heaps itself into the wave, gravity does the rest, and down you go, sliding the whole length of it. If you still cherish the notion, while sliding, that the water is moving with you, thrust your arms into it and attempt to paddle; you will find that you have to be remarkably quick to get a stroke, for that water is dropping astern just as fast as you are rushing ahead.",

    passage: "Today, watching Venus and Serena Williams dominate the sport of women’s tennis with their talent and flair, it is hard to imagine that just over fifty years ago African-American tennis players were barred from competing on the grandest stages of their sport. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947, but the walls that kept African-Americans from playing professional sports did not come tumbling down overnight. Almost four years passed from Jackie Robinson’s major league debut until a female African-American made a similar impact upon the sport of women’s tennis. That woman’s name was Althea Gibson.\n\nAlthea Gibson was born on a cotton farm on August 25, 1927, in Silver, South Carolina. The early stages of the Great Depression forced her sharecropper father to move the family from the bucolic Silver to the urban bustle of New York City when she was just three years old. As a child growing up in the Harlem section of the Manhattan, Althea found she had an affinity for athletics. Basketball and paddle tennis were her favorite sports, and she excelled at both. In fact, her talent at paddle tennis was so remarkable that in 1939 she won her age group at the New York City paddle tennis championships. Shortly after, a very good friend of Althea’s suggested that she try lawn tennis. She showed an incredible aptitude for the sport and her play caught the attention of members of the predominately African-American Harlem Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, who helped her raise money to become a member. At the age of fourteen, Althea took her first real tennis lesson at the club under the tutelage of one-armed tennis coach Fred Johnson. She would never look back.\n\nA year later in 1942, the major governing body for African-American tennis tournaments—the American Tennis Association (ATA)—sponsored the New York Girls Singles Championship at Althea’s club. With her aggressive and dominating style of play, she won the title easily. It was her first of what was to be many victories, on and off the court.\n\nAlthea dropped out of high school shortly after winning the New York Girls Championship. She found the classes boring and wanted to concentrate on tennis. Her decision raised many eyebrows amongst members of the ATA, who had hoped that she would become one of the sport’s new stars. She was encouraged to leave New York City and move to Wilmington, North Carolina to live with the family of Hubert Eaton, a wealthy doctor who was active in the African-American tennis community. Dr. Eaton welcomed Althea into his family. He not only offered her guidance with her tennis career, he also convinced her to finish the remaining three years of high school. While living with the Eaton family in Wilmington, she would travel around the country to compete in ATA tournaments. By the time she graduated in 1949, Althea had already won the first two of what would be ten consecutive ATA national titles. She was regarded by many as one of the most impressive young talents in the female game, but because of segregation she was not permitted to practice on any of the public courts in Wilmington. She was also yet to be invited to any of the major segregated tournaments.\n\nBy early 1950 Althea was making some headway. She was the first African American to play in the national indoor tournament, where she finished second. Althea believed her two national championships and her strong showing at the indoor tournament was proof that she was one of female tennis’s elite players. She and the ATA tried to lobby the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) for an invitation to the 1950 U.S. Nationals, but despite the ATA’s efforts and Althea’s obvious merit, the USLTA failed to extend her an invitation.\n\nNot every member of the USLTA was pleased with the organization’s decision. Former U.S. National and Wimbledon champion Alice Marble wrote a scathing editorial in the July 1950 issue of American Lawn Tennis magazine criticizing the USLTA’s segregationist stance. Ms. Marble wrote, “The entrance of (African-Americans) into national tennis is as inevitable as it has proven in baseball, in football, or in boxing; there is no denying so much talent. . . . If Althea Gibson represents a challenge to the present crop of players, then it’s only fair that they meet this challenge on the courts.” The editorial caused a national uproar that quickly led the USLTA to finally extend Althea an invitation to play in the 1950 U.S. Nationals tournament. This invitation would open many doors for Althea, and the following year she was the first African American to compete at Wimbledon.\n\nIt took a few years for Althea to adjust to the world-class level of play. She won her first major tournament in 1956 and would dominate the sport for the next five years, winning six doubles titles and a total of eleven Grand Slam events including the U.S. Nationals and Wimbledon twice. Yet even at the height of her career as an international tennis champ, Althea was forced to endure discrimination. She was often refused hotels rooms and reservations at restaurants simply because of her skin color. Althea once said that her extraordinary success was the product of being “game enough to take a lot of punishment along the way.” The pioneering example set by Althea Gibson paved the way for future generations of African-American tennis players, and proved that beyond her tennis glory she was a true champion of the human spirit.",

    passage: "Professional baseball suffered during the two years the United States was involved in World War I. Many Americans who were preoccupied with the seriousness of the war raging overseas had little concern for the trivialities of a baseball game. After the war ended in 1919, many Americans wanted to put those dark years behind them and get back to the normal activities of a peaceful life. One of those activities was watching baseball. In the summer of 1919, ballparks that just one year earlier had been practically empty were now filled daily with the sights and sounds of America’s favorite pastime. That year, both the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees were two of the strongest teams in baseball’s American League, but one team stood head and shoulders above the rest: The Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox, called The White Stockings until 1902, were owned by an ex-ballplayer named Charles Comiskey. Between the years of 1900 and 1915 the White Sox had won the World Series only once, and Comiskey was determined to change that. In 1915, he purchased the contracts of three of the most promising stars in the league: outfielders “Shoeless” Joe Jackson and “Happy” Oscar Felsch, and second baseman Eddie Collins. Comiskey had only to wait two years for his plan to come to fruition; the 1917 White Sox, playing in a park named for their owner, won the World Series. Two years later they had the best record in all of baseball and were again on their way to the Series.\n\nBaseball players’ salaries in that era were much different than the exorbitant paychecks of today’s professional athletes. Often, ballplayers would have second careers in the off-season because of the mediocrity of their pay. To make matters worse, war-torn 1918 was such a horrible year for baseball attendance that many owners cut player salaries for the following season. However, it is said in all of baseball there was no owner as parsimonious as Charles Comiskey. In 1917 he reportedly promised every player on the White Sox a bonus if they won the American League Championship. After winning the championship, they returned to the clubhouse to receive their bonus—a bottle of inexpensive champagne. Unlike other owners, Comiskey also required the players to pay for the cleaning of their uniforms. The Sox had the best record in baseball, but they were the least paid, were the most discontented, and wore the dirtiest uniforms.\n\nComiskey’s frugality did not sit well with the players. They were most upset with the fact that he did not raise salaries back to their 1918 levels, even though the ballpark attendance figures for 1919 were higher than any previous year. One player, Eddie Ciccotte, felt especially ill-treated by Comiskey. The owner promised the pitcher a bonus of $10,000 if he won thirty games, but after Ciccotte won his twenty-ninth game he was benched by Comiskey for the rest of the season.\n\nGamblers were such a common sight around the Chicago ballpark that Charles Comiskey had signs proclaiming “No Betting Allowed In This Park” posted conspicuously in the stands. The money with which these gamblers tempted the players was hard to refuse, and it was rumored that to supplement their income some of the lower-paid athletes would offer inside tips to the bettors. But gamblers’ mingling with ballplayers wasn’t solely confined to the White Sox. In 1920, allegations involving gambling among Chicago Cubs players brought to light a scandal that would shock Chicago and the rest of America: Eight members of the White Sox had thrown the 1919 World Series.\n\nThe exact facts regarding the scandal will never be known, but the most accepted theory is that just prior to the World Series, White Sox player Chick Gandil had approached a gambler by the name of Joseph Sullivan with a proposal that for $100,000 Gandil would make sure the Sox lost the Series. Gandil needed to recruit other players for the plan to work. It was not hard for him to do—there were many underpaid players on the White Sox who were dissatisfied with the way Comiskey operated the team. Ultimately, the seven other players that were allegedly involved in the scheme were Eddie Cicotte, Happy Felsch, Joe Jackson, Fred McMullin, Charles “Swede” Risberg, Buck Weaver, and Claude Williams.\n\nThey were successful. The Chicago White Sox, heavily favored to beat an inferior Cincinnati Reds team, lost the nine-game World Series in eight games, due in most part to the inferior play of the eight conspiring players. When the scandal made headlines the following year the press began to refer to them as the Black Sox, and the ignominious label would be used to describe them forever.\n\nWhen the eight players stood before an Illinois grand jury, it was determined that that there was not enough substantial evidence for any convictions, and the players were all eventually acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing. Interestingly enough, Charles Comiskey paid for the players’ high-priced defense lawyers. Unfortunately for Comiskey, there was to be no similar reprieve from major league baseball: Every single one of the accused players was banned from the game for life. Comiskey’s once mighty team was decimated by the loss of its most talented players, and the 1921 White Sox finished the season in seventh place.",

    passage: "For several months an unwonted activity has prevailed in one quarter of Athens. Herodes Atticus Street behind the royal garden, one of the most retired streets of the city, has resounded all day long with the rattle of heavy wagons bringing blocks of marble from Pentelikon. At sunrise and sunset crowds of workingmen are seen moving through this street, the lower end of which opens upon a bridge across the Ilissos, and on the opposite bank lies the Panathenaic Stadium, now being lined with marble for the Olympic games which are to be held in it early in April. The time is short, and the work is being pressed forward.\n\nWhen the International Athletic Committee, at a session in Paris last year, decided to have a series of athletic contests once in four years in various countries, it is not surprising that they selected Greece for the first contest. Although Greece now has as little of the athletic habit as any nation of the civilized world, its past is interwoven with athletics. Olympia is a magic word, and the committee were doubtless swayed partly by sentimental reasons in the choice of name and place. But some may wonder why, since the games come to Greece, they are not to be held at Olympia, to justify the name which they have taken. This is because the originators of the scheme, although they have conceded something to sentiment, are no visionaries, but men of practical common sense. Even their concession to sentiment is likely to turn out to be a clever piece of practical management, calculated to launch the games upon the world with more success than could have been secured in any other way. The games also have a name which will be just as true in 1900 at Paris, and 1904 in America, as it is this year in Athens.\n\nNow, however fine a thing it might be to let athletes stir real Olympic dust, and to let runners put their heels into the very groove of the old starting-sill, with the feeling that thirty centuries looked down upon them, it would not be practical. A successful athletic contest cannot be held in the wilderness. It demands a crowd and sustenance for a crowd. The crowd is the one essential concomitant of the athletes. But a crowd will not go where it cannot eat and sleep. To bring to Olympia a concourse sufficient to in modern times make the games anything like a success would demand the organization of a first-class commissary department, and that too for a service of half a month only. Shelter and food for such an occasion come naturally only in connection with some city with a market. Ancient Olympia, with all its magnificent buildings, was of course that sort of city, albeit practically a deserted city except for a few days once in four years.\n\nThe visitors at Athens next April—and it is hoped that there will be tens of thousands of them—will doubtless feel keenly enough the inadequacy even of a city of 130,000 inhabitants, to give them all that they seek in the way of material comforts. The problem of seating a large crowd of spectators did not come up before the International Committee. But it is this problem which has found a most happy solution in Athens. The Stadium at Olympia, although excavated at each end by the Germans, still lies in most of its course under fifteen or twenty feet of earth. But the Stadium at Athens has always been a fit place for a monster meeting, provided people would be contented to sit on its sloping sides without seats. When a local Athenian committee was formed, composed of most of the citizens conspicuous for wealth or position, and some resident foreigners, under the presidency of Constantine, crown prince of Greece, one of the first questions before it was this question of seating; and its attention was naturally directed to the Stadium.\n\nA wealthy and generous Greek of Alexandria, George Averoff, who was known as a man always on the watch to do something for Athens, readily took upon himself the expense of restoring the Stadium to something like its former splendor, when it was lined with marble and seated fifty-thousand spectators. He has already given over nine hundred thousand drachmas, which, if the drachma were at par, would be $180,000, but which now amounts to only about $100,000. There is a sub-committee of the general committee above described, designated as the committee on the preparation of the Stadium, composed of several practical architects, but including also the Ephor General of Antiquities, and the directors of the foreign archaeological schools. The presence of the archaeological element on this committee emphasizes the fact that the new work is to be a restoration of the old.",

    passage: "PASSAGE 1\nReader, have you ever been at Plymouth? If you have, your eye must have dwelt with ecstasy upon the beautiful property of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe: if you have not been at Plymouth, the sooner that you go there the better. You will see ships building and ships in ordinary; and ships repairing and ships fitting; and hulks and convict ships, and the guard-ship; ships ready to sail and ships under sail; besides lighters, men-of-war’s boats, dockyard-boats, bum-boats, and shore boats. In short, there is a great deal to see at Plymouth besides the sea itself: but what I particularly wish now is, that you will stand at the battery of Mount Edgcumbe and look into Barn Pool below you, and there you will see, lying at single anchor, a cutter; and you may also see, by her pendant and ensign, that she is a yacht. You observe that this yacht is cutter-rigged, and that she sits gracefully on the smooth water. She is just heaving up her anchor; her foresail is loose, all ready to cast her—in a few minutes she will be under way. You see that there are ladies sitting at the taffrail; and there are five haunches of venison hanging over the stern. Of all amusements, give me yachting. But we must go on board. The deck, you observe, is of narrow deal planks as white as snow; the guns are of polished brass; the bitts and binnacles of mahogany: she is painted with taste; and all the moldings are gilded. There is nothing wanting; and yet how clear and unencumbered are her decks! Let us go below. There is the ladies’ cabin: can anything be more tasteful or elegant? Is it not luxurious? And, although so small, does not its very confined space astonish you, when you view so many comforts so beautifully arranged? This is the dining-room, and where the gentlemen repair. And just peep into their state-rooms and bed-places. Here is the steward’s room and the buffet: the steward is squeezing lemons for the punch, and there is the champagne in ice; and by the side of the pail the long-corks are ranged up, all ready. Now, let us go forwards: here are, the men’s berths, not confined as in a man-of-war. No! Luxury starts from abaft, and is not wholly lost, even at the fore-peak. This is the kitchen; is it not admirably arranged? And how delightful are the fumes of the turtle-soup! At sea we do meet with rough weather at times; but, for roughing it out, give me a yacht.\n\nPASSAGE 2\nMy very first sea voyage was in a small merchant vessel out of New York called the Alba. I was only twelve years old at the time, and full of dreams of boundless adventure upon the high seas. I was to serve as the ship’s boy. I was given the post by my Uncle Joseph, the weathered old captain of the Alba who uttered few words, choosing to speak more with his menacing gaze than with his mouth. The moment I stepped upon the bustling deck my Uncle Joseph set me straight about shipboard life. There were to be no special privileges afforded to me because of our relations. I was to live and mess in the ‘tween decks with the other seamen, and because I was his nephew, I would probably have to work twice as hard as the others to prove my worth. From that point on I was to refer to my uncle as “Sir” or “Captain,” and only speak to him when he addressed me. He then told me a bit about the Alba. I learned that she was a cutter, and all cutters were fore-and-aft rigged, and possessed only a single mast. After my brief lesson, he then sent me below deck to get myself situated.\n\nWhat I found when I dismounted the ladder below was an entirely different world than the orderly brightness of the top deck. Here was a stuffy and dimly lit space barely tall enough for me to stand up straight in. It was the middle of July, and the heat was oppressive. There seemed to be no air at all, there certainly were no windows, and the stench that rose up from the bilge was so pungent it made me gag. From the shadows, a pair of eyes materialized. They belonged to a grimy boy no older than me. “Hello mate, you must be the new lubber just shipped aboard. I’m Nigel. Follow me, we’re just in time for dinner.” My new friend led me into the tiny dining room where the crew messed. The men ate shoulder to shoulder on wooden tables bolted to the deck. The horrific smell of so many men crammed together was overpowering. We received our food from the ship’s cook, a portly man in a filthy apron who, with the dirtiest hands I’d ever seen, ladled us out a sort of stew. We found two open spots at a mess table and sat down to eat. The stew was lukewarm and the mysterious meat in it was so tough I could barely chew it. I managed to swallow a few spoonfuls and pushed my dish aside. With a smile that was graveyard of yellow sincerity, Nigel pushed the dish back to me and said, “I’d get used to the grub, mate. It ain’t so bad. Besides, this is the freshest it’ll be on the voyage.”\n\nAfter dinner, Nigel showed me our berth. It was a tiny lightless cubbyhole near the bow of the boat that was barely six feet long and only five feet high. There was a small area where I could stow my clothes, and at night we would string up our hammocks side by side with two other boys, both of whom were on duty at the moment. That night when we were under way, the boat ran into a vicious Atlantic storm. The waves tossed the Alba around like it was a tiny raft. The ship made such noises; I was afraid it would simply break apart at any moment. The seawater that crashed upon the deck leaked through the planks and dripped upon my head. It would have bothered me if I were not already horribly seasick. As I lay there miserably rocking back and forth in my damp hammock, I asked myself, “What have I gotten myself into?”",

    passage: "Could good dental hygiene be man’s earliest custom? The findings of paleontologist Leslea Hlusko suggest that 1.8 million years ago early hominids used grass stalks to clean their teeth. Many ancient hominid teeth unearthed in archaeological digs have curved grooves near the gumline. Hlusko posited that these grooves were evidence of teeth cleaning by early man. However, critics pointed out that even though the use of toothpicks is still a common practice among modern man similar grooves are not found on modern teeth.\n\nHlusko, convinced that she was on the right track, experimented with grass stalks to see if they might have been the cause of the grooves. Unlike the wood used for modern toothpicks, grass contains hard silica particles that are more abrasive than the soft fibers found in wood. A stalk of grass is also about the same width as the marks found on the ancient teeth. To prove her theory Dr. Hlusko took a baboon tooth and patiently rubbed a grass stalk against it for eight hours. As she suspected, the result was grooves similar to those found on the ancient hominid teeth. She repeated the experiment with a human tooth and found the same result.\n\nIt seems that our early human ancestors may have used grass, which was easily found and ready to use, to floss between their teeth. As Hlusko suggests in the journal Current Anthropology, “Toothpicking with grass stalks probably represents the most persistent habit documented in human evolution.”",

    passage: "From year to year, the economic well being of many Americans changes considerably, even though the median income of the population as a whole does not vary much in real terms from one year to the next. One measure of economic well being is the income-to-poverty ratio. This ratio measures a family’s income compared to the poverty threshold (the income below which a family is considered to be in poverty) for that family. For example, the poverty threshold for a three-person family in 1994 was $11,817. A three person family with an income of $20,000 would have an income-to-poverty ratio of 1.69 ($20,000 / $11,817).\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 roughly three-quarters of the population saw their economic well being fluctuate by 5% or more. Conversely, from year to year less than a quarter of Americans had stable incomes. In the 1990s fewer people saw their income grow than in the 1980s, and more people saw their incomes decline. Although the state of the economy is a notable factor in determining if incomes rise or fall, changes in personal circumstances are just as important. People had a good chance of seeing their income rise if they began to work full time, the number of workers or adults in their house increased, they married, or the number of children in the household decreased. Conversely, people could expect a decrease in their income if they ceased to be married or to work full-time.\n\nAnother factor that affected the direction of change in family income was its place on the economic ladder. The closer a family was to poverty the more likely they were to see their income rise. Whereas, 45% of families at the top of the economic ladder, those with income-to-poverty ratios of more than 4.0, experienced income decreases in 1994. While age, gender, and race play a significant role in determining one’s place on the economic ladder, these factors are not good predictors of a rise or fall in income. The only population for which one of these factors was significant was the elderly, whose incomes tended to be fairly stable.",

    passage: "Beliefs are easily the most enduring and distinctive aspects of maritime culture. Traditional beliefs, commonly called superstitions, are convictions that are usually related to causes and effects, and are often manifest in certain practices. Common examples include beliefs about good and bad luck, signs for predicting the weather, interpretations of supernatural happenings, and remedies for sickness and injury.\n\nBecause maritime occupations often place workers in a highly unpredictable and hazardous environment, it is not surprising that fishermen hold many beliefs about fortune and misfortune. A primary function of such beliefs is to explain the unexplainable. Watermen can cite many actions that invite bad luck. These actions include uttering certain words while aboard a boat, taking certain objects aboard a boat, going out in a boat on a certain day, or painting boats certain colors. Among Florida fishermen, saying “alligator,” bringing aboard shells or black suitcases, and whistling are all considered bad luck while on a boat.\n\nBeliefs about actions that invite good luck appear to be fewer in number than those about bad luck. Beliefs about good luck include breaking a bottle of champagne or other liquid over the bow of a vessel when it is launched, participating in a blessing-of-the-fleet ceremony, placing a coin under the mast, carrying a lucky object when aboard, and stepping on or off the boat with the same foot. There are many beliefs about predicting the weather and the movement of fish. These beliefs are often linked to the detection of minute changes in the environment and reflect fishermen’s intimate contact with the natural environment.\n\nA Florida shrimp fisherman told a researcher that when shrimps’ legs are blood red you can expect a strong northeaster or strong southeaster. The direction of the wind is used to predict the best location for catching shrimp. Other signs for weather prediction include rings around the moon, the color of the sky at sunrise and sunset, and the color and texture of the sea. Sometimes beliefs are expressed in concise rhymes. An oysterman from Apalachicola, Florida, uses the rhyme, “East is the least, and west in the best” to recall that winds from the west generally produce conditions that are conducive to good catches.\n\nBeliefs related to the supernatural—the existence of ghosts, phantom ships, burning ships, or sea monsters—are also found in maritime communities. Many fishermen are reluctant to discuss the supernatural, so these beliefs are less conspicuous than those about luck and the weather. However, one net maker told a researcher about his encounter with a ghost ship. He saw a schooner, a ship that was prevalent in the nineteenth century, come in across the Gulf and pass through water that was far too shallow for a ship of its size. The ship then suddenly disappeared from sight.\n\nCommercial fishing is considered to be the most hazardous of all industrial occupations in the United States. Statistics show that fishermen are seven times more likely to die than workers in the next most dangerous occupation. Adhering to a system of beliefs most likely helps bring sense and order to a world in which natural disasters and misfortune are a part of daily life. Many fishermen also make a precarious living at best. Maritime beliefs contain the collective wisdom of generations and following these traditions may help fishermen catch more fish without taking unnecessary risks.",

    id: "p69-parenting",
    passage: "Does a baby have a moral conscience? While a baby is not faced with many serious ethical dilemmas, his or her moral character is formed from the earliest stages of infancy. Recent research has shown that the type of parenting an infant receives has a dramatic impact on the child’s moral development and, consequently, success later in life. The renowned childcare expert T. Berry Brazelton claims that he can observe a child of eight months and tell if that child will succeed or fail in life. This may be a harsh sentence for an eight-month-old baby, but it underscores the importance of educating parents in good child-rearing techniques and of intervening early in cases of child endangerment.\n\nBut what are good parenting techniques? The cornerstone of good parenting is love, and the building blocks are trust, acceptance, and discipline. The concept of “attachment parenting” has come to dominate early childhood research. It is the relatively simple idea that an infant who is firmly attached to his or her “primary caregiver”—often, but not always, the mother—develops into a secure and confident child. Caregivers who respond promptly and affectionately to their infants’ needs—to eat, to play, to be held, to sleep, and to be left alone—form secure attachments with their children. A study conducted with rhesus monkeys showed that infant monkeys preferred mothers who gave comfort and contact but no food to mothers who gave food but no comfort and contact. This study indicates that among primates love and nurturing are even more important than food.\n\nFortunately, loving their infants comes naturally to most parents and the first requisite for good parenting is one that is easily met. The second component—setting limits and teaching self-discipline—can be more complicated. Many parents struggle to find a balance between responding promptly to their babies’ needs and “spoiling” their child. Norton Garfinkle, chair of the Executive Committee of the Lamaze Institute for Family Education, has identified four parenting styles: warm and restrictive, warm and permissive, cold and restrictive, and cold and permissive. A warm parent is one who exhibits love and affection; a cold parent withholds love; a restrictive parent sets limits on her child’s behavior and a permissive parent does not restrict her child. Garfinkle finds that the children of warm-restrictive parents exhibit self-confidence and self-control; the children of warm-permissive parents are self-assured but have difficulty following rules; children of cold-restrictive parents tend to be angry and sullenly compliant, and the most troubled children are those of cold-permissive parents. These children are hostile and defiant.\n\nThe warm-restrictive style of parenting helps develop the two key dimensions of moral character: empathy and self-discipline. A warm attachment with his or her parent helps the child develop empathetic feelings about other human beings, while parental limit-setting teaches the child self-discipline and the ability to defer gratification. The ability to defer gratification is an essential skill for negotiating the adult world. A study conducted by Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, tested a group of four-year-olds’ ability to defer gratification. Each child in the study was offered a marshmallow. The child could choose to eat the marshmallow right away or wait fifteen minutes to eat the marshmallow and receive another marshmallow as a reward for waiting. Researchers followed the children and found that by high school those children who ate their marshmallow right away were more likely to be lonely, more prone to stress, and more easily frustrated. Conversely, the children who demonstrated self-control were outgoing, confident, and dependable.\n\nThis research seems to answer the old adage, “you can’t spoil a baby.” It seems that a baby who is fed at the first sign of hunger and picked up on demand can perhaps be “spoiled.” Most parents, however, tend to balance their baby’s needs with their own. Many parents will teach their baby to sleep through the night by not picking up the baby when she awakes in the middle of the night. Although it can be heart wrenching for these parents to ignore their baby’s cries, they are teaching their baby to fall asleep on her own and getting the benefit of a full night’s sleep. While many parents will come to good parenting techniques instinctually and through various community supports, others parents are not equipped for the trials of raising a baby. Are these babies doomed to lives of frustration, poor impulse-control, and anti-social behavior? Certainly not. Remedial actions—such as providing enrichment programs at daycare centers and educating parents—can be taken to reverse the effects of bad parenting. However, the research indicates that the sooner these remedies are put into action the better.",

    id: "p70-potlatch-kula",
    passage: "PASSAGE 1\nAmong traditional societies of the Pacific Northwest—including the Haidas, Kwakiuls, Makahs, Nootkas, Tlingits, and Tsimshians—the gift-giving ceremony called potlatch was a central feature of social life. The word potlatch, meaning “to give,” comes from a Chinook trading language that was used all along the Pacific Coast. Each nation, or tribe, had its own particular word for the ceremony and each had different potlatch traditions. However, the function and basic features of the ceremony were universal among the tribes.\n\nEach nation held potlatches to celebrate important life passages, such as birth, coming of age, marriage, and death. Potlatches were also held to honor ancestors and to mark the passing of leadership. A potlatch, which could last four or more days, was usually held in the winter when the tribes were not engaged in gathering and storing food. Each potlatch included the formal display of the host family’s crest and masks. The hosts performed ritual dances and provided feasts for their guests. However, the most important ritual was the lavish distribution of gifts to the guests. Some hosts might give away most or all of their accumulated wealth in one potlatch. The more a host gave away, the more status was accorded him. In turn, the guests, who had to accept the proffered gifts, were then expected to host their own potlatches and give away gifts of equal value.\n\nPrior to contact with Europeans, gifts might include food, slaves, copper plates, and goat’s hair blankets. After contact, the potlatch was fundamentally transformed by the influx of manufactured goods. As tribes garnered wealth in the fur trade, gifts came to include guns, woolen blankets, and other Western goods. Although potlatches had always been a means for individuals to win prestige, potlatches involving manufactured goods became a way for nobles to validate tenuous claims to leadership, sometimes through the destruction of property. It was this willful destruction of property that led Canadian authorities, and later the U.S. government, to ban potlatches in the late 1880s.\n\nDespite the ban, the potlatch remained an important part of native Pacific Northwest culture. Giving wealth—not accumulating wealth, as is prized in Western culture—was a means of cementing leadership, affirming status, establishing and maintaining alliances, as well as ensuring the even distribution of food and goods. Agnes Alfred, an Indian from Albert Bay, explained the potlatch this way, “When one’s heart is glad, he gives away gifts. . . . The potlatch was given to us to be our way of expressing joy.”\n\nPASSAGE 2\nThe inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific, are united by a ceremonial trading system called the kula ring. Kula traders sail to neighboring islands in large ocean-going canoes to offer either shell necklaces or shell armbands. The necklaces, made of red shells called bagi, travel around the trading ring clockwise, and the armbands, made of white shells called mwali, travel counterclockwise.\n\nEach man in the kula ring has two kula trading partners—one partner to whom he gives a necklace for an armband of equal value, although the exchanges are made on separate occasions, and one partner with whom he makes the reverse exchange. Each partner has one other partner with whom he trades, thus linking all the men around the kula ring. For example, if A trades with B and C, B trades with A and D, and C trades with A and E, and so on. A man may have only met his own specific kula partners, but he will know by reputation all the men in his kula ring. It can take anywhere from two to ten years for a particular object to complete a journey around the ring. The more times an object has made the trip around the ring the more value it accrues. Particularly beautiful necklaces and armbands are also prized. Some famous kula objects are known by special names and through elaborate stories. Objects also gain fame through ownership by powerful men, and, likewise, men can gain status by possessing particularly prized kula objects.\n\nThe exchange of these ceremonial items, which often accompanies trade in more mundane wares, is enacted with a host of ritual activities. The visitors, who travel to receive kula from their hosts, are seen as aggressors. They are met with ritual hostility and must charm their hosts in order to receive the necklaces or armbands. The visitors take care to make themselves beautiful, because beauty conveys strength and protects them from danger. The hosts, who are the “victims” of their visitors’ charm and beauty, give the prized objects because they know that the next time it will be their turn to be the aggressor. Each man hopes that his charm and beauty will compel his trading partner to give him the most valuable kula object.\n\nThe objects cannot be bought or sold. They have no value other than their ceremonial importance, and the voyages that the traders make to neighboring islands are hazardous, time-consuming, and expensive. Yet, a man’s standing in the kula ring is his primary concern. This ceremonial exchange has numerous tangible benefits. It establishes friendly relations through a far-flung chain of islands; it provides a means for the utilitarian exchange of necessary goods; and it reinforces the power of those individuals who win and maintain the most valuable kula items. Although the kula ring might mystify Western traders, this system, which has been in operation for hundreds of years, is a highly effective means of unifying these distant islanders and creating a common bond among peoples who might otherwise view one another as hostile outsiders.",

    id: "p71-affirmative-action",
    passage: "When I began teaching at Big State U in the late 1960s, the students in my American literature survey were almost uniformly of European heritage, and most were from middle-class Protestant families. Attending college for these students was a lesson in homogeneity. Although a number of students were involved in the Civil Rights Movement and some even worked “down South” on voter registration, most students considered segregation to be a Southern problem and many did not see the discrimination that was rampant on their own campus.\n\nSince the 1960s there has been a sea change in university admissions. Key Supreme Court decisions and federal laws made equal opportunity the law of the land, and many institutions of higher learning adopted policies of affirmative action. The term affirmative action was first used in the 1960s to describe the active recruitment and promotion of minority candidates in both the workplace and in colleges and universities. President Lyndon Johnson, speaking at Howard University in 1965, aptly explained the reasoning behind affirmative action. As he said, “You do not take a man who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him to the starting line in a race and then say, ‘You are free compete with all the others,’ and still believe that you have been completely fair.” Affirmative action programs in college admissions have been guided by the principle that it is not enough to simply remove barriers to social mobility but it is also necessary to encourage it for minority groups.\n\nIn recent years, affirmative action programs have come under public scrutiny, and some schools have been faced with charges of reverse discrimination. Preferential treatment of minority applicants is seen as discrimination against qualified applicants from the majority group. Despite widespread support for the elimination of prejudice, most whites do not favor the preferential treatment of minority applicants, and affirmative action in college admissions has been abolished in several states. In my view, this trend is very dangerous not only for minority students but for all students. Thanks to a diversified student body, my classes today are much richer than when I began teaching in the 1960s. For example, when I teach A Light in August by William Faulkner, as I do every fall, today there is likely to be a student in the class who has firsthand knowledge of the prejudice that is a central theme of the novel. This student’s contribution to the class discussion of the novel is an invaluable part of all my students’ education and a boon to my experience as a teacher.\n\nSome may argue that affirmative action had its place in the years following the Civil Rights Movement, but that it is no longer necessary. To assume that all students are now on a level playing field is naïve. Take for example the extra-curricular activities, AP classes, and internships that help certain applicants impress the admissions board: These are not available or economically feasible for many minority candidates. This is just one example of why affirmative action still has an important place on American campuses. When all things are equal, choosing the minority candidate not only gives minorities fair access to institutions of higher learning, but it ensures diversity on our campuses. Exposing all students to a broad spectrum of American society is a lesson that may be the one that best prepares them to participate in American society and succeed in the future.",

    passage: "In the days when the world was new, all the wisdom in the world was scattered. Nyame, the Sky God, possessed a great pot that contained all the wisdom there was. Anansi the Spider, who was as clever as he was greedy, decided that he wanted all the wisdom for himself. He went to Nyame and, through flattery and trickery, persuaded the Sky God to give him the pot. 'I will keep it safe,' Anansi promised, 'and share it when the time is right.'\n\nNyame, amused by the little spider's arrogance, gave him the pot. Anansi scurried away, delighted. He peered inside and learned how to weave intricate webs, how to predict the weather, and how to outsmart the leopard. But Anansi was paranoid. 'If I leave this pot in my house,' he thought, 'someone might steal it.' He decided to hide it at the very top of the tallest silk-cotton tree in the forest.\n\nHe tied the heavy clay pot to his stomach with a vine and began to climb. But the pot was cumbersome. It bumped against his knees and scraped against the bark. He slipped, slid, and struggled, making very little progress. \n\nUnknown to Anansi, his young son, Ntikuma, was watching from the bushes. Ntikuma saw his father struggling and called out, 'Father! Why do you tie the pot to your front? If you tied it to your back, your hands would be free and the climbing would be easy!'\n\nAnansi stopped. He was the owner of all wisdom, yet his young son had seen the solution he had missed. In a fit of temper and embarrassment, Anansi shouted, 'I have the pot of wisdom, yet a child tells me what to do!' He realized that wisdom is useless if it is not shared or applied correctly. In his frustration, he threw the pot down from the tree.\n\nCrash! The pot shattered into thousands of pieces. The wisdom inside flew out like a swarm of bees. It drifted on the wind, scattering across the four corners of the earth. People everywhere caught bits of it.

    id: "passage-74-panama-canal",
    passage: "The construction of the Panama Canal stands as one of the supreme engineering feats of the 20th century, a testament to human ingenuity and determination in the face of overwhelming natural obstacles. The dream of a waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans dates back to the early Spanish explorers, who hauled gold across the Isthmus of Panama. However, it was not until 1880 that the French, led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, broke ground. The French effort was doomed by poor planning, financial mismanagement, and, most devastatingly, disease. Malaria and yellow fever, transmitted by mosquitoes, decimated the workforce, claiming an estimated 20,000 lives before the French abandoned the project in 1889.\n\nIn 1904, the United States took over the project under the leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt. The Americans quickly realized that controlling disease was a prerequisite for construction. Colonel William C. Gorgas was placed in charge of sanitation. Implementing the then-revolutionary theories that mosquitoes carried malaria and yellow fever, Gorgas launched a massive campaign to fumigate homes, drain swamps, and screen windows. Within two years, yellow fever was virtually eliminated, and malaria cases dropped significantly. With the health crisis managed, the engineering challenge took center stage.\n\nUnlike the sea-level Suez Canal, the Panama Canal required a lock system to lift ships 85 feet above sea level to the man-made Gatun Lake and then lower them back down on the other side. This required the excavation of the Culebra Cut, a nine-mile channel through the Continental Divide. It was a Herculean task involving steam shovels, dynamite, and thousands of laborers from the West Indies, Europe, and America. Landslides were a constant plague; often, months of work would be undone in hours as the unstable earth collapsed into the cut. \n\nDespite these hardships, the canal opened on August 15, 1914. The 50-mile passage reduced the sea voyage from New York to San Francisco by nearly 8,000 miles. It revolutionized global trade and military strategy. Today, the canal remains a vital artery of commerce, though it faces new challenges. Modern supertankers often exceed the size limits of the original locks, prompting a massive expansion project completed in 2016 to accommodate these 'Neopanamax' vessels.",

    id: "passage-76-bioluminescence",
    passage: "On a moonless night in the Caribbean, a boat cuts through the water, leaving a glowing wake of neon blue. This is not magic, but bioluminescence, one of nature’s most fascinating chemical phenomena. Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. While fireflies are the most familiar example on land, the phenomenon is far more common in the ocean, where at least 1,500 species of fish, jellyfish, bacteria, and crustaceans possess the ability to glow.\n\nThe chemistry behind the glow involves two main components: a molecule called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. When luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of luciferase, energy is released in the form of light. This reaction is incredibly efficient. A traditional incandescent light bulb wastes about 90% of its energy as heat, emitting only 10% as light. In contrast, the bioluminescent reaction is nearly 100% efficient, producing almost no heat, which is why it is often called 'cold light.'\n\nMarine organisms use this light for a variety of survival strategies. The most common is defense. Some squid shoot out a cloud of glowing mucus to confuse predators, similar to how an octopus uses ink. This 'burglar alarm' effect can also reveal the predator to its own enemies. Other creatures use light for camouflage. The hatchetfish, for example, has light-producing organs on its belly. By matching the light intensity of the surface water above, the fish becomes invisible to predators looking up from below, a strategy known as counter-illumination.\n\nBioluminescence also plays a role in feeding and mating. The anglerfish, a deep-sea dweller, dangles a glowing lure in front of its mouth to attract unsuspecting prey. In the mating game, fireflies use specific flash patterns to identify members of their own species and attract partners. Scientists are now studying these mechanisms to apply them to medical research. By tagging cancer cells with bioluminescent proteins, researchers can track the progression of disease and the effectiveness of treatments in real-time, proving that the light of the deep sea may one day help save lives on land.",

    passage: "From 'The Odyssey' by Homer (Book XII)\n\n'Meanwhile our good ship, with that perfect wind to drive her, fast approached the Sirens' Isle. But now the breeze dropped, some power lulled the waves, and a breathless calm set in. The men rose and struck the sails; they stowed them in the hollow ship and sat to the oars, thrashing with polished fir the white foam of the sea. Then I, taking a massive wheel of wax, chopped it into bits and kneaded them in my strong hands, and the wax soon grew soft, worked by my strength and the burning heat of the sun, the Lord Hyperion's child. I anointed the ears of all my men in turn, and they bound me in the ship, hand and foot, upright in the mast-step, and lashed me to the mast. Then they sat and struck the gray surf with their oars.\n\nWe were no further off than a man's shout carries, and moving fast, when the Sirens caught sight of the swift ship bearing down, and burst into their high clear song:\n\n'Come this way, honored Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians, and stay your ship, so that you can listen here to our singing; for no one else has ever sailed past this place in his black ship until he has listened to the honey-sweet voice that issues from our lips; then goes on, well-pleased, knowing more than ever he did; for we know everything that the Argives and Trojans did and suffered in wide Troy through the gods' despite. Over all the generous earth we know everything that happens.'\n\nSo they sang, in sweet utterance, and the heart within me desired to listen, and I signaled to my companions to set me free, nodding with my brows, but they leaned on and rowed hard, and Perimedes and Eurylochus rose up and hurried to bind me with more cords and tighten them. But when we had gone past these, and could no longer hear the voice of the Sirens or their singing, my eager companions were quick to peel the wax from their ears, and they loosed me from my bonds.'",

    passage: "Long ago in ancient Japan, there lived an old bamboo cutter named Taketori no Okina. One day, while walking through the bamboo grove, he saw a mysterious, glowing stalk of bamboo. Overcome with curiosity, he carefully cut it open and found inside a tiny girl, no bigger than his thumb. Delighted, he took her home to his wife, and they raised her as their own child, naming her Kaguya-hime, or 'Princess Kaguya.' From that day on, whenever the old man cut bamboo, he found a nugget of gold inside. The family soon became rich, and Kaguya-hime grew into a woman of extraordinary beauty.\n\nWord of her beauty spread throughout the land, attracting five noble princes who sought her hand in marriage. Kaguya-hime, however, had no desire to marry. To dissuade them, she devised impossible tasks. She asked the first prince to bring her the stone begging bowl of the Buddha from India; the second, a jeweled branch from the island of Penglai; the third, the legendary robe of the fire-rat of China; the fourth, a colored jewel from a dragon's neck; and the fifth, a cowry shell born from a swallow. One by one, the princes failed, some presenting fakes that were easily exposed, others giving up in despair or suffering injury in their quests.\n\nEventually, the Emperor himself came to woo her. Kaguya-hime refused him as well, though she treated him with kindness, telling him that she was not of this world and could not marry an earthly ruler. They kept up a correspondence by letter, exchanging poems.\n\nAs the years passed, Kaguya-hime became increasingly melancholic whenever she looked at the full moon. Finally, she revealed the truth to her foster parents: she was not of the earth, but a being from the Moon Capital, sent to earth for safety during a celestial war (or, in some versions, as punishment). The time had come for her to return. The old bamboo cutter was heartbroken and asked the Emperor for guards to protect her from the moon people. \n\nOn the night of the full harvest moon, a celestial entourage descended from the sky on clouds. The Emperor’s guards were blinded by a strange light and could not fight. Kaguya-hime was given a robe of feathers; once she put it on, all her memories of and attachment to the earth would be forgotten. She wrote a final note to the Emperor and gave him the Elixir of Life. She donned the robe and ascended to the moon, leaving her earthly parents weeping.\n\nThe Emperor, filled with grief, asked his servants which mountain was closest to Heaven. They told him it was the Great Mountain in Suruga Province. He ordered his men to take the letter and the Elixir of Life to the peak and burn them, for he did not wish to live forever without Kaguya-hime. The smoke from that fire is said to still rise from the mountain, which was named 'Fuji' (immortality), and the character for the mountain can also mean 'mountain abounding with warriors,' referring to the Emperor's ascent.",

    passage: "The Great Library of Alexandria, established in the 3rd century BCE in Egypt, stands as one of the most potent symbols of ancient knowledge and its tragic loss. Founded by Ptolemy I Soter, a successor of Alexander the Great, and expanded by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the library was conceived not merely as a repository for books, but as a universal research institute—the Museion, or 'Temple of the Muses.' Its ambitious goal was to collect all the world's knowledge under one roof. Agents were sent across the known world to purchase or copy texts, and ships docking in Alexandria were famously searched for scrolls, which were confiscated, copied, and the copies (not the originals) returned to the owners. This aggressive acquisition policy amassed a collection estimated between 40,000 and 400,000 scrolls, including works by Homer, Plato, Socrates, and countless lost treatises on mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.\n\nBeyond its collection, the Library was a vibrant intellectual hub. It hosted legendary scholars such as Eratosthenes, who calculated the circumference of the Earth; Euclid, the father of geometry; and Archimedes, the great inventor. These scholars lived on the campus, supported by the royal patronage, free to pursue research, translation, and teaching. The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, is said to have been produced here.\n\nThe destruction of the Library is a subject of historical debate, often simplified into a single cataclysmic fire. In reality, its decline was likely gradual, the result of centuries of neglect, budget cuts, and periodic violence. One famous incident occurred in 48 BCE, when Julius Caesar, besieged in Alexandria, set fire to his own ships in the harbor; the flames reportedly spread to the warehouses near the shore, destroying thousands of scrolls. Later, the Emperor Aurelian (270s CE) fought a counter-insurgency in the Bruchion district, likely damaging the library precincts. Finally, religious decrees in the late 4th century CE by Emperor Theodosius I, ordering the destruction of pagan temples, may have sealed the fate of the Serapeum, a sister library. The final dissolution of the intellectual community came with the Muslim conquest in 642 CE, though by then, the Great Library as a monolithic entity had likely long ceased to exist.\n\nThe loss of the Library of Alexandria represents a bottleneck in human history. Had the collection survived, the Dark Ages might have been illuminated by the preserved wisdom of antiquity. Today, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, opened in 2002 near the site of the ancient library, stands as a modern commemoration, attempting to recapture the spirit of universal knowledge in the digital age.",

The story begins with the cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*), native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. The Olmecs, one of the earliest civilizations in Latin America, were likely the first to domesticate the cacao plant around 1500 BCE. However, it was the Maya and later the Aztecs who fully integrated chocolate into their culture.\n\nFor the Maya, chocolate (or *xocolatl*) was a revered brew made from roasted and ground cacao seeds mixed with water, cornmeal, and chili peppers. It was poured from a height between vessels to create a thick, frothy foam, which was considered the most desirable part. This drink was not merely a beverage but a sacred substance used in religious rituals, marriage ceremonies, and as a medicinal remedy. The Aztecs valued cacao beans so highly that they used them as currency; a rabbit might cost ten beans, while a slave could cost one hundred. The Aztec emperor Montezuma II was famously reported to drink fifty cups of chocolate a day from a golden goblet, believing it conferred strength and virility.\n\nThe trajectory of chocolate changed forever with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the early 16th century. Hernán Cortés, seeking gold and power, encountered the Aztec beverage. While initially unimpressed by the bitter taste, the Spanish recognized its stimulating effects and nutritional value. They brought cacao beans back to Spain, where the recipe underwent a radical transformation. The chili peppers were replaced with sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to suit the European palate. For nearly a century, the Spanish kept the secret of chocolate to themselves, but eventually, its popularity spread to the royal courts of France and England.\n\nIn Europe, chocolate remained an expensive luxury drink for the aristocracy until the Industrial Revolution. In 1828, a Dutch chemist named Coenraad van Houten invented the cocoa press, a machine that could separate the cocoa butter from the roasted cacao beans, leaving a fine powder. This innovation made chocolate cheaper to produce and easier to mix with water. Later, in 1847, the British company J.S. Fry & Sons discovered that by adding some of the melted cocoa butter back into the powder, they could create a moldable paste—the world's first solid chocolate bar. Finally, in 1875, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter, collaborating with Henri Nestlé, added condensed milk to the mixture, creating milk chocolate. These technological advancements democratized chocolate, transforming it from a drink of the gods into a treat for the masses.",
